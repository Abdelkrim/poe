<p>The <code>Asset</code> entity is the subject of an ODRL policy expression that permissions and prohibitions are applied to. The Asset entity can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, or services. Furthermore, it can be used to represent other <code>Asset</code> entities that are needed to undertake the Policy expression, such as with the <code>Duty</code> entity. The <code>Asset</code> entity is referred to by the <code>Permission</code> and/or <code>Prohibition</code> entities, and also by the <code>Duty</code> entity.</p>
<p>The <code>Asset</code> entity contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the <code>Asset</code> (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>The identification of the <code>Asset</code> entity is a key foundation of the ODRL Policy language. However, there are some use cases where the ODRL Policy expression MAY be embedded inside the target <code>Asset</code>. In these cases, it MAY be more appropriate to provide, or infer, a link to the <code>Asset</code> entity (as the complete <code>Asset</code> <code>uid</code> may not be known at the time) through the local context. Use of such inference and context MUST be documented in the relevant ODRL community Profile.</p>
<p>Since ODRL policies could deal with any kind of asset, the ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata to describe <code>Asset</code> entities of particular media types. It is recommended to use already existing metadata standards, such as <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/" rel="external nofollow">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> that are appropriate to the <code>Asset</code> type or purpose.</p>
<p>The <code>Relation</code> entity is used to associate the <code>Asset</code> entity with the relevant <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, and <code>Duty</code> entities</p>
