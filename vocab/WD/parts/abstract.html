    <p>A permissions and obligations expression system should provide a flexible and interoperable information model that supports transparent and innovative use and resue of digital content across all sectors and communities. The ODRL Information Model  supports the business models of open, educational, government, and commercial communities through profiles that align with their specific requirements whilst retaining a common semantic layer for cross-domain interoperability.</p>
  
<h2>Relationship to the W3C ODRL Community Group Reports</h2>

    
<p>The basis for the deliverables for the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group are the reports created by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a>. The ODRL Community Group has developed a family of specifications to support transparent and innovative use of digital assets in the publishing, distribution and consumption of content. The ODRL specifications have been adpoted by a number of leading industry sectors, such as the <a href="http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/technical-information/release-program/current-releases/drm-v2-2">Mobile sector</a> and the <a href="http://dev.iptc.org/RightsML">News industry</a>.</p>
<p>The outputs of the ODRL Community Group were the ODRL Version 2.1 specifications that were a major update for ODRL and superseded the original ODRL Version 1.1 [[odrl]] (published as a W3C NOTE)</p>
    
<p>The following documents are part of the ODRL Community Group report series:</p>
<ul>
<li>ODRL V2 Requirements [[odrl2-req]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Core Model [[odrl21-model]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Common Vocabulary [[odrl21-vocab]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 XML Encoding [[odrl21-xml]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Ontology [[odrl21-onto]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 JSON Encoding [[odrl21-json]]</li>
</ul>

 <p>
This specification was derived from the ODRL Community Group's outcomes, and details of the differences are maintained in the <a href="#community">Changes from the ODRL Community Group Reports</a> Appendix.
</p>
    <p>All new ODRL implementations are expected to use the deliverables of the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group. </p>
