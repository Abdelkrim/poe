    ODRL Policies that support the <code>Privacy</code> type may contain links to potentially sensitive personal information such as the identity of parties and the identity of the existance of assets containing such data related to the parties. Implementations that produce or consume ODRL Privacy expressions must take steps to communicate to all relevant users the manner in which the policy is being used, the identity of any other party with whom that policy is being shared, and the reason the policy is being shared with other parties.
