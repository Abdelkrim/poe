<h2>Introduction</h2>   

    <p>The ODRL Vocabulary and Expression specifies the set of RDF classes, predicates and named entities that are used by the ODRL Information Model [[!odrl-model]] which defines the ODRL Core Vocabulary. This  document also lists recommended terms in the ODRL Common Vocabulary that may be used to define ODRL Profiles. </p>
	
	<p>In addition to supported RDF serialisations, the ODRL Vocabulary and Expression provides the JSON-LD Context and profile definitions needed to use the ODRL JSON serialisation in a Linked Data context, and includes an alternate XML serialisation.</p>
