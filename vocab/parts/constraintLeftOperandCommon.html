<p>This section contains instances of LeftOperands that can be used as the leftOperand of a Constraint . The LeftOperands may be used in Constraints for either the constraint property (applying to a Rule) or a refinement property (applying to the Action). ODRL policy expressions should utilise Constraints that are appropriate for the intended semantics of the LeftOperand.</p>
