<p>For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation, there must be at least two independent implementations of each feature described below. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of products, and there is no requirement that any single product implement every feature.</p>

    <b>Features</b>

    <p>
      For the purposes of evaluating exit criteria, the following are considered as features:
    </p>

    <ul>
	<li>A Set/Offer/Agreement Policy type with required properties</li>
	<li>A Policy that utilises an ODRL Profile</li>
	<li>A Policy with an Asset Collection, includig parts</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Party Collection, including parts</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Rule including a constraint property</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Permission including a duty property</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Permission including a duty and a consequence property</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Prohibition</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Prohibition including a remedy property</li>
	<li>A Policy with an Obligation</li>
	<li>A Policy with a refinement property on an Action, Asset and Party Collection</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Logical Constraint</li>
	<li>A Compact Policy that requires translation into an Atomic Policy</li>
	<li>A Policy containing metadata</li>
	<li>A Policy that includes Policy inheritance</li>
		<li>A Policy that includes a Conflict Strategy</li>
      
    </ul>

<p>
In addition, the ODRL Vocabulary will be considered valid when the following conditions have been demonstrated:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The ontology documents can be parsed without errors by RDF Schema validators</li>
<li>The ontology is internally consistent with respect to domains, ranges, inverses, and any other ontology features specified</li>
<li>The JSON-LD context document can be parsed without errors by JSON-LD validators</li>
<li>The JSON-LD context document can be used to convert JSON-LD serialized Annotations into RDF triples</li>
</ul>

    <p>
      Software that does not alter its behavior in the presence or lack of a given feature is not deemed to implement that feature for the purposes of exiting the Candidate recommendation phase.
    </p>
