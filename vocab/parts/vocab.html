<p>The ODRL Vocabulary formally defines the semantics for the concepts and terms from the ODRL Information Model [[!odrl-model]] and the vocabulary terms that can be used for common use cases for ODRL Policy expressions. The figure below shows the grouping of concepts and terms used in this section.</p>

   <div class="issue" data-number="64">
        <p>This section is normative, meaning that the concepts and terms presented are required by ODRL expression systems. However, a number of terms have yet to reach the level of implementation that warrants them to be deemed normative. As a result, some terms in this section will be explicitly labelled as "non-normative".</p>
       <p>The current terms that are deemed normative are taken from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/wiki/images/8/88/ODRLImplementationSurvey-2016-Dec-07.pdf">ODRL Implementors Survey in December 2016</a> (PDF document). </p>
           <p> Future versions of the ODRL Vocabulary MAY update these terms as more implementation experience is gained.</p>
