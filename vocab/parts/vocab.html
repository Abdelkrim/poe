<p>The ODRL Vocabulary formally defines the semantics for the concepts and terms from the ODRL Information Model [[!odrl-model]] and the vocabulary terms that can be used for common use cases for ODRL Policy expressions. </p>

<p>The figure below shows the grouping of concepts and terms used in the ODRL Vocabulary. Each (dark blue) rounded box represents the core concepts from the Information Model, and each (yellow) rectangular box represents a vocabulary of applicable terms. </p>

   <div class="issue" data-number="64">
        <p>This section is normative, meaning that the concepts and terms presented are required by ODRL expression systems. However, a number of terms have yet to reach the level of implementation that warrants them to be deemed normative. As a result, some terms in this section are explicitly labelled with the status "non-normative".</p>
       <p>The current terms that are marked normative are taken from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/wiki/images/8/88/ODRLImplementationSurvey-2016-Dec-07.pdf">ODRL Implementors Survey in December 2016</a> (PDF document). </p>
           <p>Future versions of the ODRL Vocabulary MAY update these terms to be normative based on more implementation experience, from community feedback, as well as determintion as to the core parts of the ODRL Information Model.</p>
