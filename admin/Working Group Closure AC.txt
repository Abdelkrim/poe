Dear Advisory Committee Representative,

This message is to inform you that the Permissions & Obligations Expression Working Group is now closed:

https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/

The Working Group has reached the end of its charter and no further progress is expected on the deliverables.

The Working Group focused on developing the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) model and vocabulary. ODRL is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL policies. The Working Group published, in February 2018, two Recommendations:

https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-odrl-model-20180215/
https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-odrl-vocab-20180215/

For a more detailed history of the technology and the work leading to the Working Group and the Recommendations, see a separate blog:

If you have any further questions, please contact Ivan Herman <ivan@w3.org>

This announcement follows section 5.2.7 of the Process Document [1].
