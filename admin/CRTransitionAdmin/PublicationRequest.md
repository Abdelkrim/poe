Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of two ODRL Documents as Candidate Recommendations. The publication date is the 26 of September, 2017. The transition request for CR has been issued in:

	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2017JulSep/0150.html

the Director's approval is in:

	@@@@@@


The documents are as follows
----------------------------

ODRL Information Model
https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-odrl-model-20170926/

ODRL Vocabulary & Expression
http://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-odrl-vocab-20170926/

Abstract and Status Sections
----------------------------

See the previous URL-s

The documents are already in place and pass the pubrules' checker.

The link checker has a few of problems with the ODRL Vocabulary & Expression. These are due to the fact that three URL-s refer to namespaces that do not have an HTML representations. I have checked the reported broken fragments, and they are all fine. The three URL-s are:

http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns


Thanks!

Denis,

this is just a preliminary publication request. The POE Working Group has requested a CR transition for two documents[1], to be published on the Tuesday, 26 of September. The two documents are:

ODRL Information Model
ODRL Vocabulary & Expression

The two document snapshots are already available

https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/CR-odrl-model-20170926/
https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/CR-odrl-vocab-20170926/

And I will put them on the /TR/2017/ as soon as we have the Director's decision.

Both documents go through pubrule's checker. The Link checker reports three errors for the second document, namely broken links (with possibly broken fragments) for:

http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns

but these are the usual problems with namespace documents that do not have an HTML representation. I have checked the fragments manually and they are all fine.

Thank you!

Ivan
