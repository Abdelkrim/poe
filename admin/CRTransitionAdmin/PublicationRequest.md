Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of two ODRL Documents as Candidate Recommendations. The publication date is the 26 of September, 2017. The transition request for CR has been issued in:

	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2017JulSep/0150.html

the Director's approval is in:

	https://www.w3.org/2017/09/22-poe-cr-minutes.html#resolution01


The documents are as follows
----------------------------

ODRL Information Model
https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-odrl-model-20170926/

ODRL Vocabulary & Expression
http://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-odrl-vocab-20170926/

Abstract and Status Sections
----------------------------

See the previous URL-s

There are already snapshots on github:

https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/CR-odrl-model-20170926/index.html
https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/CR-odrl-vocab-20170926/index.html

but these will still undergo cosmetic changes as a result of the CR transition call. I plan to install those document in the course of Monday the 25th. 

The link checker has a few of problems with the ODRL Vocabulary & Expression. These are due to the fact that these URL-s refer to namespaces that do not have an HTML representations. I have checked the reported broken fragments, and they are all fine. The three URL-s are:

Thanks!
