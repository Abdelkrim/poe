[DRAFT AC Mail] ODRL 2.2 is now a Recommendation

Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
Chairs,

I am pleased to announce that the following documents are now W3C  Recommendations:

ODRL Information Model
    https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-odrl-model-20180215/

ODRL Vocabulary & Expression
    https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-odrl-vocab-20180215/


The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL policies.

All Members who responded to the Call for Review [1] showed support or abstained, several expressed intention to use the vocabulary or implement it.

Please join us in congratulating the W3C Permissions & Obligations Expression Working Group[2] on this achievement.

This announcement follows section 7.1.2 [3] of the W3C Process Document.

Thank you,

For Tim Berners-Lee, Director, and
Philippe le HÃ©garet, Project Management Lead;
Ivan Herman, PE&O WG Staff Contact;
Xueyuan Jia, W3C Marketing & Communications
