To be sent as soon as the documents pass pubrules

----

Denis,

this is just a preliminary publication request. The POE Working Group has requested a Rec transition for two documents[1], to be published on the Thursday, 15 of February. The two documents are:

ODRL Information Model
ODRL Vocabulary & Expression

The two document snapshots are already available

- https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/REC-odrl-model-20180215/index.html
- https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/REC-odrl-vocab-20180215/index.html

And I will put them on the /TR/2018/ as soon as we have the Director's decision.

There is a strange error raised by pubrules' checker:

"No GitHub repository issue link. The link is expected to be of the form https://github.com/<USER_OR_ORG>/<REPO_NAME>/issues[/â€¦]"

whereas there a link in the header to our issues' list... Help:-) 

The Link checker reports three errors for the second document, namely broken links (with possibly broken fragments) for:

- http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema
- http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
- http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns

but these are the usual problems with namespace documents that do not have an HTML representation. I have checked the fragments manually and they are all fine.

Thank you!

Ivan
