Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of two ODRL Documents as Recommendations. The publication date is the 15 of January, 2018. The transition request for PR has been issued in:
- @@@@

the Director's approval is in:
- @@@@


The documents are as follows
----------------------------

ODRL Information Model 2.2:
- https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-odrl-model-20180215/

ODRL Vocabulary & Expression 2.2:
- http://www.w3.org/TR/2018/PR-odrl-vocab-20180215/


Additional TR modification
--------------------------

As an additional action, there is an old document (a W3C Note):

https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl/
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-odrl-20020919/

That needs a remark on the top that notifies the reader about the availability of the new Recommendations. I have a new version on my disc, I only need your greed light to update the document. 


Abstract and Status Sections
----------------------------

See the previous URL-s

The documents have already been installed on the URL-s above.

The link checker has a few of problems with the ODRL Vocabulary & Expression. These are due to the fact that these URL-s refer to namespaces that do not have an HTML representations. I have checked the reported broken fragments, and they are all fine. The three URL-s are:

- http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema
- http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
- http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns


Thanks!
