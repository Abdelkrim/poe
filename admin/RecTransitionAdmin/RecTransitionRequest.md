Dear Ralph,

The Call for review for the POE Recommendations have ended on the 4th of February 2018:

https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/odrl-pr/results

The Permissions & Obligations Expression Working Group requests the green light to publish the Recommendatations that were reviewed. Here are the details:
W3M.


(1) Document title, URIs, Abstract and Status
=============================================

ODRL Information Model 2.2
--------------------------

- Version ready to be published:
    - https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/REC-odrl-model-20180215/index.html
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-odrl-model-20180215/

Abstract:

The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL policies.

Policies are used to represent permitted and prohibited actions over a certain asset, as well as the obligations required to be meet by stakeholders. In addition, policies may be limited by constraints (e.g., temporal or spatial constraints) and duties (e.g. payments) may be imposed on permissions.

Status:
- http://w3c.github.io/poe/model/#sotd

    - http://www.w3.org/TR/2018/PR-odrl-vocab-20180215/

Abstract:

The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services.
