Dear Ralph,

The Call for review for the POE Recommendations have ended on the 4th of February 2018:

https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/odrl-pr/results

The Permissions & Obligations Expression Working Group requests the green light to publish the Recommendations that were reviewed. Here are the details:


(1) Document title, URIs, Abstract and Status
=============================================

ODRL Information Model 2.2
--------------------------

- Version ready to be published:
    - https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/REC-odrl-model-20180215/index.html
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-odrl-model-20180215/

Abstract:

The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL policies.

Policies are used to represent permitted and prohibited actions over a certain asset, as well as the obligations required to be meet by stakeholders. In addition, policies may be limited by constraints (e.g., temporal or spatial constraints) and duties (e.g. payments) may be imposed on permissions.

Status:
- http://w3c.github.io/poe/model/#sotd

ODRL Vocabulary & Expression 2.2
--------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
    - https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/REC-odrl-vocab-20180215/index.html
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
    - http://www.w3.org/TR/2018/PR-odrl-vocab-20180215/

Abstract:

The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. The ODRL Vocabulary and Expression describes the terms used in ODRL policies and how to encode them.

Status:
- http://w3c.github.io/poe/vocab/#sotd

https://github.com/w3c/poe/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22PR+Review%22+

None of these comments were significants (mostly typos); some, actually, did not refer to the recommendations themselves (e.g., issues #239 and #224).


(4) Disposition of Comments
===========================

https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/odrl-pr/results

22 votes have been cast. 7 members abstained. 15 members voted to publish the document as is.


(5) Objections
==============

There were no formal objections.


(6) Patent disclosures
======================

No patent disclosures for these documents:

(7) Life after Rec
==================

Errata for the document will be recorded on Github:

https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/errata/

and managed (i.e., approve or disapprove, propose changes) by the ODRL Community Group:

https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/

(8) Miscellaneous
=================

- The group plans to publish a Working Group Note on ODRL Best Practices. Although a first draft already exists (https://w3c.github.io/poe/bp/), the group is not sure when it will be in a publishable state, so the decision is to publish that document a few weeks after the publication of the Recommendations.

- The group will prepare an ODRL, i.e., machine readable version of the W3C Software and Document license. That will be linked from the BP document using a <link> tag in the header, and will provide an example on how that can be used in other W3C documents.
