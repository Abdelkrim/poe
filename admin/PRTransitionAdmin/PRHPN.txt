Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Call for Review: ODRL is a W3C Proposed Recommendation

----------------------------

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/">Permissions & Obligations Expression Working Group</a> has just published a Proposed Recommendation for two documents, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/PR-odrl-model-20180104/">ODRL Information Model 2.2</a> — The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL policies.
<br/>
Policies are used to represent permitted and prohibited actions over a certain asset, as well as the obligations required to be meet by stakeholders. In addition, policies may be limited by constraints (e.g., temporal or spatial constraints) and duties (e.g. payments) may be imposed on permissions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/PR-odrl-vocab-20180104/">ODRL Vocabulary & Expression 2.2</a> — The ODRL Vocabulary and Expression describes the terms used in ODRL policies and how to encode them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Comments are welcome through 4 February 2018.</p>
