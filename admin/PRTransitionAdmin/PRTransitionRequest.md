Ralph,

The  Permissions & Obligations Expression Working Group requests transition to PR status for two specifications on ODRL. The publication is planned for the 2018-01-04; the documents are follows:

- ODRL Information Model 2.2
- ODRL Vocabulary & Expression 2.2

Also, due to the fact that the charter of the Working Group runs on on the 31st of December, 2017, the Working Group requests a small charter extension until the 28th of February, 2018, to properly accompany the PR transition and publish the two Recommendations. We would appreciate if this could be put on the agenda of W3M.


(1) Document title, URIs, Abstract and Status
=============================================

ODRL Information Model 2.2
--------------------------

- Version ready to be published:
    - https://w3c.github.io/poe/model/
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/PR-odrl-model-20180104/

Abstract:

The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL policies.

Policies are used to represent permitted and prohibited actions over a certain asset, as well as the obligations required to be meet by stakeholders. In addition, policies may be limited by constraints (e.g., temporal or spatial constraints) and duties (e.g. payments) may be imposed on permissions. 

Status:
- http://w3c.github.io/poe/model/#sotd

ODRL Vocabulary & Expression 2.2
--------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
    - http://w3c.github.io/poe/vocab/
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
    - http://www.w3.org/TR/2018/PR-odrl-vocab-20180104/

Abstract:

The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. The ODRL Vocabulary and Expression describes the terms used in ODRL policies and how to encode them.

Status:
- http://w3c.github.io/poe/vocab/#sotd


(2) Proposed publication date, and review dates
===============================================

January 4, 2018. The group proposes the 4th of February as the end of the review period.


(3) Records of the decision to request the transition:
======================================================

Decision to request the transition was made on 11th of December:
- https://www.w3.org/2017/12/11-poe-minutes.html#resolution1


(4) Evidence That Documentation Satisfies Group's Requirements
==============================================================

The main input to this Working Group was the ODRL family of documents, developed by the ODRL Community Group:
- https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/

which is widely deployed (and most implementations are now converting to the output of this Working Group). An additional requirement document was published by the working group:

- POE Use Cases and Requirements
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/poe-ucr/

Which has an evolving Editor's draft:
- https://w3c.github.io/poe/ucr/

See also more details in the CR Transition request
- https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2017JulSep/0150.html


(5) Disposition of Comments and Changes Since CR
================================================

The disposition of all comments received during the Candidate Recommendation phase are part of the github issues' list:
- https://github.com/w3c/poe/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22CR+review%22+

All resulting changes are editorial, and the main ones are listed in the respective documents' change sections:
- http://w3c.github.io/poe/model/#changes
- http://w3c.github.io/poe/vocab/#changes


(6) Objections
==============

There were no formal objections.

(7) Features marked as "at risk"
================================

None. 

(8) Patent disclosures
======================

No patent disclosures for these documents at the moment:
- https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/87755/exclude

(9)  Implementation information
===============================

A description of the test suite (which will evolve during the CR period) and how implementors should run them is here:
- https://github.com/w3c/poe/blob/gh-pages/test/test-regime.md

The tests are grouped along the features explicitly listed in the exit criteria:
- https://w3c.github.io/poe/model/#cr-exit
- https://w3c.github.io/poe/vocab/#cr-exit

The implementation results are listed in:
- https://w3c.github.io/poe/test/implementors
- https://w3c.github.io/poe/test/vocab-results

By the Polytechnic University of Madrid, IPTC, and Thomson-Reuters. The resulting test result fulfill the exit criteria (at least two, independent implementations for each feature). 

Additional, albeit partial, implementations are worked on at the Technical University of Vienna, but they could not make it for the PR transition deadline.
