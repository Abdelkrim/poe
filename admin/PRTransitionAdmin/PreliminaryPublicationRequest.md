To be sent as soon as the documents pass pubrules

----

Denis,

this is just a preliminary publication request. The POE Working Group has requested a PR transition for two documents[1], to be published on the Thursday, 4 of January. The two documents are:

ODRL Information Model
ODRL Vocabulary & Expression

The two document snapshots are already available

- https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/PR-odrl-model-20180104/
- https://w3c.github.io/poe/snapshots/PR-odrl-vocab-20180104/

And I will put them on the /TR/2018/ as soon as we have the Director's decision.

Both documents go through pubrule's checker. The Link checker reports three errors for the second document, namely broken links (with possibly broken fragments) for:

- http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema
- http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
- http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns

but these are the usual problems with namespace documents that do not have an HTML representation. I have checked the fragments manually and they are all fine.

Thank you!

Ivan
