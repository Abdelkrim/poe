# CR Exit Criteria

For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation, there must be at least two independent implementations of each feature described below. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of products, and there is no requirement that any single product implement every feature.

For the purposes of evaluating exit criteria, the following are considered as features:

* A Set/Offer/Agreement Policy and required properties.
* A Policy with an AssetCollection.
* A Policy with a PartyCollection.
* A Policy with a Permission including an Atomic Constraint and Duty
* A Policy with a Prohibition including an Atomic Constraint
* A Policy with a Permission and Prohibition
* A Policy with Constraint with all properties
* A Policy with Compound Constraints
* A Policy with Asset Constraints
* A Policy with Party Constraints
* A Policy that requires translation into an atomic Policy
* A Policy containing metadata
* A Policy that includes Policy inhertiance
* A Policy that includes conflict strategy


Software that does not alter its behavior in the presence or lack of a given feature is not deemed to implement that feature for the purposes of exiting the Candidate recommendation phase.
