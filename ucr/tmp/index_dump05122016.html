All use cases provide realistic examples describing how people and organisations may (or want to be able to) specify statements about digital content usage. The requirements derived from these use cases will be used to guide the development of the POE WG recommendation deliverables for the Information Model, Vocabulary and Encodings. </p>

For queries against the index to return appropriate results for a user, we must track which schemes they (or their institution) is a member of and filter based upon these, which therefore translates into a requirement for the metadata being indexed to include information identifying which are applicable (we term these "audience URIs"). Note that this is not an access-control mechanism (this should be implemented and enforced at the media location), rather a means of ensuring that an optimal user experience is delivered.

					<div class="visible uc"> <p>In the news industry, rights holders and editors need to establish the permissions and restrictions associated with content.</p>
					<p>
					<dl>
					<dt>What Do Rights Holders Want?</dt><dd> In general, rights holders will require that a set of permissions, restrictions, and duties be obeyed for a defined set of content. And they can require additional restrictions or duties for individual items within the larger content set. Rights holders wish to restrict the use of their content by factors such as:
					<ul>
						<li>Geography (e.g. "No use in China")</li>
						<li>Time (e.g. "No archive after 3 days")</li>
						<li>Distribution channel (e.g. "No mobile")</li>
					</ul>
					They also want to enforce duties such as:
					<ul>
						<li>Payment (e.g. "You can use this photo online for EUR80")</li>
						<li>Attribution (e.g. "Credit Kyoto News")</li>
					</ul>
					Often, rights holders need to constrain the use of their content in complex ways, i.e., with combined constraints (e.g, "No use in UK after 7 days").
					Generally, rights holders want to be able to:
					<dl>
					  <dt>Create a bundle of permissions, restrictions and duties</dt>
						<dd>The rights holder creates a set of permissions and restrictions with constraints, together with any duties that the editor must perform, in order to unlock the permissions. The set may be associated with one or more sets of content. Therefore the policy bundle must have a unique identifier. </dd>
					  <dt>Identify one or more items of content to be treated as a set</dt>
						<dd>The rights holder defines one or more content items which are to be treated as a set. The set must have a unique identifier.</dd>
					  <dt>Bind a policy to a set of content</dt>
						<dd>The rights holder asserts that a given set of content is governed by a given policy. Note that a given content item might be a member of more than one set of content. Therefore, a given content item may have more than one policy associated with it. </dd>
					</dl></dd>
					
					
					<!--</p>-->
					<dt>What Do Editors Want?</dt><dd> Ideally, not to worry about rights at all. Essentially, editors want to know the answer to the question "Can I use this content in this way?" and, if the answer is yes, "Are there any duties?". It is not unusual for editors to have access to content that they are not permitted to republish. Or that they can only republish in certain ways (e.g., only in print but not on a mobile app). Editors want to be able to:
					<dl>
					  <dt>Create a bundle of action and context"</dt>
						<dd>An editor identifies a content use in context, meaning a particular action they propose to take with pieces of content (e.g. "print", "distribute", "archive") and any relevant context for that action (e.g. location="France"). The types of context for an action correspond to possible constraints which could apply to the use of a piece of content. The use is not tied to one particular piece of content. The use must have a unique identifier. </dd>
					 <dt>Determine whether a use is permitted for a particular content item</dt>
					 <dd>At the point where an Editor wishes to use a particular piece of content in a particular way, the policies must be evaluated to determine whether it is permitted and whether there are any duties that must be fulfilled. The possible results are therefore: "yes", "no" or "maybe". </dd>

							<p> IEEE 1599 is an international XML-based standard that aims to comprehensively describe music content by supporting the representation of heterogeneous music aspects within a single XML document. Moreover, IEEE 1599 lets spatio-temporal relationships emerge among such materials, thanks to the identification of music events inside a common data structure known as the spine: in this way, events can be described in different layers (e.g., a chord’s graphical aspect and its audio performance), as well as multiple times within a single layer (e.g., different music performances of the same events). Consequently, the IEEE 1599 multilayer environment presents two complementary synchronization modes: inter-layer and intra-layer synchronization. Coupling these two categories of synchronization makes it possible to design and implement frameworks that allow new kinds of interaction with media contents and novel music-experience models, as shown in the Music Box area of the EMIPIU web framework (see URL above). Recognizing music events and their synchronization can be seen as an additional intellectual achievement that on one side does not affect the already existing IP rights on media contents, but on the other side requires adequate protection. Consequently, it is desirable to consider a new permission which allows the producer to synchronize different media contents with respect to the other possibly existing permissions, restrictions and duties associated with media contents.

This example specifies that the serviceProvider grants the permission to access the dataset and commits to serve the data with a certain quality, more concretely, 99% availability of a SPARQL endpoint associated with the dataset. This is expressed as a duty on the service provider with a constraint that is defined using a DQV metric (<code>:sparqlEndpointUptime</code>) that has to be greater than a certain value (99). The <code>odrl:assignee</code> is the Party is the recipient of the policy statement and the <code>odrl:assigner</code> is the Party is the issuer of the policy statement. For discussion about this example see <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-odrl/2016Feb/0000.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-odrl/2016Feb/0000.html</a>

							<p> The expression of constraints in ODRL seems quite unfit with expressing general constraints on values in RDF graphs, as we would require here. However, ODRL can be easily extended, and is schedule to undergo refinement in the context of the W3C Permissions & Obligations Expression Working Group. In the future DQV implementers should investigate whether a general constraint expression language like the coming SHACL provides a more appropriate mechanism to be used on top of ODRL permissions and duties. </p>

							<p> Most large book publishers have developed their own internal databases/systems for managing rights and permissions information, but in many cases these systems have become out of date and insufficient for tracking the kinds of granular rights data needed to take advantage of new and forthcoming opportunities for content licensing. In addition, in many cases rights departments at large publishing houses are segmented from acquisitions and editorial departments, deepening the divide between the rights information collected for new works and that which is needed—digital assets are not always defined from the point of acquisition. A standard set of discrete permissions data including a variety of digital rights would provide an efficient system for publishers to begin collecting this information. Currently a large amount of revenue is left on the table because of insufficient knowledge of rights held, and lack of an efficient system for collecting and communicating permissions data that incorporates the breadth of licensing models available. A standardized model and vocabulary for expressing permissions and obligations information would facilitate both the management of content licensed from others and the monetization of content licensed to others. </p>
							<p>To be clear, this use case does not envision creating a standard for publishers to use as the sole basis for their internal databases/systems; rather, it envisions a standard way of ingesting and outputting rights and permissions information, with which publishers’ internal databases should interoperate.</p>

The database is housed in an internal system but insufficient rights information exists due in part to the lack of a clear system for collecting and managing rights and permissions information. The UP needs a standard system for labeling rights held and rights sold/purchased in order to efficiently execute rights deals internationally. Consistency of contractual language terminology and meaning among international trading partners is key: rights language across internal database and clients’ database is often misaligned. Additionally, many transactions are still done or initiated in person; these transactions are difficult to track because of database limitations—currently, status; interactions; and contacts for international rights transactions on a large number of titles gets lost.

							<p> Clear terminology for permissions and obligations associated with accessing a work— be it through a library, classroom (for course materials), software application, online repository, or other portal needs to be established and defined in a standard way so that the licensing environment (library, classroom, etc.) can treat works from multiple rights holders according to such permissions and obligations. This access is distinct from copyright held on the work and needs to be treated as such in metadata that is attached to a work. University presses, who regularly provide access to published works to students across a variety of platforms, have a particular need to see access better accounted for in rights data.

							<p> Improve the flow of rights data among publishers, libraries, and library service providers. No single metadata standard is used among book publishers, libraries, and service providers to communicate rights and permissions data for library materials. Clear rights data is not being communicated to libraries: several libraries, both university-based and public, report a lack of consistent and accurate rights and permissions information for the content in their collections, inhibiting libraries from providing electronic access to a large portion of content and making library collection data difficult to manage. This is especially true for print works which libraries wish to digitize and make available to patrons or publicly.

							<p> Higher education curriculum service providers (e.g. e-textbook services) would like to be able to offer course instructors the ability to compose single textbook volumes (whether in print or ebook) from materials sourced from multiple publications from one publisher or  multiple publishers. For example, an instructor could assemble a custom physics textbook with a chapter on angular momentum from one publisher’s textbook, friction from another publisher’s textbook, gravity from another, etc., plus her own treatment of magnetic fields.  One of the reasons why no one has been able to offer a scalable service of this type is the difficulty of licensing content from multiple higher ed publishers in a flexible and automated manner.
