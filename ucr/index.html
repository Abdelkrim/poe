        <h3>POE.UC.01 Permissions and obligations for language resources</h3>
        <ul>
        <li> <b>Title</b>: Permissions and Obligations for Language Resources 
        </li>
        <li> <b>Contributor</b>: Víctor Rodríguez on behalf of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/community/ld4lt/">W3C Linked Data For Language Technology Community Group</a>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Industry</b>: Language resources industry 
        </li>
        <li> <b>Description</b>: Language resources (lexicons, dictionaries, machine translation, etc.) are collected in repositories. Publishers would like to express what is permitted and what it is not.
        <p>Language resources are highly valuable resources now being massively translated to Linked Data. See the diagram here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://linghub.lider-project.eu/llod-cloud">Linguistic Linked Data Cloud</a>
        Different Language Resource Catalogs exist, like the one of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a>, or the one of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://metashare.elda.org/">META-SHARE</a>, LRMAP, Linghub, etc. 
        These resources need to be browswed and queried, and the permissions information must be in a machine-readable form in order to facilitate search-by-permission and in order to allow the automated processing of permission expressions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li> <b>POE requirements</b>: 
        <ol>
        <li> All the requirements of ODRL
