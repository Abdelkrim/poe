					<p>Language resources (lexicons, dictionaries, machine translation, etc.) are collected in repositories. Publishers would like to express what is permitted and what it is not.</p>
						<p>Language resources are highly valuable resources now being massively translated to Linked Data. See the diagram here: <a class="external text" href="http://linghub.lider-project.eu/llod-cloud">Linguistic Linked Data Cloud</a>.
							Different Language Resource Catalogs exist, like the one of <a class="external text" href="https://clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a>, or the one of <a class="external text" href="http://metashare.elda.org/">META-SHARE</a>, LRMAP, Linghub, etc.
							These resources need to be browsed and queried, and the permissions information must be in a machine-readable form in order to facilitate search-by-permission and in order to allow the automated processing of permission expressions.

					<!--<li> <strong>Industry</strong>: Language resources industry </li>-->

					<p> A publisher of Linked Data (or in general a RDF dataset) wants to selectively make available parts (e.g. named graphs) of a dataset. Availability depend on ODRL policies, the context and the ODRL Request and ODRL Ticket. For example, given a dataset, one might want to serve it under the following conditions: <em>"Anybody can access named graph <code>ex:graph1</code>, but can only access <code>ex:graph2</code> during 2016. Individual triples in <code>ex:graph3</code> can be accessed at the price of 1 &euro; cent."</em>

					<!--<li> <strong>Industry</strong>: Language resources industry </li>-->

					<p> Researchers are strongly encouraged (and now routinely required) to publish data supporting their scholarly published papers. Irrespective of the terms under which the paper is published (although usually open access), the data is generally expected to be made freely and openly available. However, this may happen after an embargo period. The purpose of the embargo period is to allow the researcher or research team creating the dataset to have a publication based on it published before colleagues can access the dataset and generate their own publications.

					<!--<li> <strong>Industry</strong>: Language resources industry </li>-->

					<p>Technical documents describe how to handle and what are the functionalities of a certain product or process (e.g., telecommunication codes). They are intended to provide information about what can/cannot be done with the product or within a certain process. Given the huge dimension of this kind of legal texts and their diffusion in the companies, the advantages of returning a machine-readable representation of such texts would allow to have in this representation a kind of summary of the main constraints expressed in the documents, with invaluable time saving for every person that is expected to read the whole document before obtaining this information. A specific usage of such a kind of texts is that of manually extracting the set of obliged/prohibited/permitted actions in order to check whether certain business processes are compliant with the legal text they should refer to. Moreover, issues related to the merging of updated versions of the documents, with amendments with respect to the policies and duties expressed in the former versions.

				<h2><dfn>POE.UC.05</dfn>: Determine an identifier representing the audience who can access a digital resource</h2>

					<!-- <li> <strong>Title</strong>:   </li> -->
					<p class="contributor">Mo McRoberts, BBC </p>
					<!--<li> <strong>Industry</strong>: Language resources industry </li>-->

					<p>The Research & Education Space platform, developed jointly by the BBC and partners, indexes Linked Open Data describing media that is available both to the public, and specifically for those in formal education, primarily in the UK. Even within this latter group, there are a range of different licensing schemes and access mechanisms which are not mutually-exclusive. For queries against the index to return appropriate results for a user, we must track which schemes they (or their institution) is a member of and filter based upon these, which therefore translates into a requirement for the metadata being indexed to include information identifying which are applicable (we term these "audience URIs"). Note that this is not an access-control mechanism (this should be implemented and enforced at the media location), rather a means of ensuring that an optimal user experience is delivered.

					<p class="contributor">Phil Archer for the Big Data Europe Project </p>
					<!--<li> <strong>Industry</strong>: Language resources industry </li>-->

					<p>OpenPHACTS integrates pharmacological data from a wide range of sources and provides an API through which different identifiers for the same thing can be reconciled, reducing barriers to drug discovery in industry, academia and for small businesses. Some data is open but not all. It may come with a variation of a Creative Commons License; some data is visible to all users, some to members, some only to the original data owner.</p>
					<p>
Rather than attempt to make assertions about what an end user can or cannot do with the data available through its API, OpenPHACTS is careful to simply make clear to its users where data came from and under what terms. It is then up to the end user to assess whether their intended use is, or is not, compliant with those terms.

				<h2><dfn>POE.UC.07</dfn>: News Permissions and Restrictions</h2>

					<!-- <li> <strong>Title</strong>:   </li> -->
					<p class="contributor">Stuart Myles</p>
					<!--<li> <strong>Industry</strong>: Language resources industry </li>-->

					<p>In the news industry, rights holders and editors need to establish the permissions and restrictions associated with content.</p>
					<p>
					<dl>
					<dt>What Do Rights Holders Want?</dt><dd> In general, rights holders will require that a set of permissions, restrictions, and duties be obeyed for a defined set of content. And they can require additional restrictions or duties for individual items within the larger content set. Rights holders wish to restrict the use of their content by factors such as:
					<ul>
						<li>Geography (e.g. "No use in China")</li>
						<li>Time (e.g. "No archive after 3 days")</li>
						<li>Distribution channel (e.g. "No mobile")</li>
					</ul>
					They also want to enforce duties such as:
					<ul>
						<li>Payment (e.g. "You can use this photo online for EUR80")</li>
						<li>Attribution (e.g. "Credit Kyoto News")</li>
					</ul>
					Often, rights holders need to constrain the use of their content in complex ways, i.e., with combined constraints (e.g, "No use in UK after 7 days").
					Generally, rights holders want to be able to:
					<dl>
					  <dt>Create a bundle of permissions, restrictions and duties</dt>
						<dd>The rights holder creates a set of permissions and restrictions with constraints, together with any duties that the editor must perform, in order to unlock the permissions. The set may be associated with one or more sets of content. Therefore the policy bundle must have a unique identifier. </dd>
					  <dt>Identify one or more items of content to be treated as a set</dt>
						<dd>The rights holder defines one or more content items which are to be treated as a set. The set must have a unique identifier.</dd>
					  <dt>Bind a policy to a set of content</dt>
						<dd>The rights holder asserts that a given set of content is governed by a given policy. Note that a given content item might be a member of more than one set of content. Therefore, a given content item may have more than one policy associated with it. </dd>
					</dl></dd>

					<!--</p>-->
					<dt>What Do Editors Want?</dt><dd> Ideally, not to worry about rights at all. Essentially, editors want to know the answer to the question "Can I use this content in this way?" and, if the answer is yes, "Are there any duties?". It is not unusual for editors to have access to content that they are not permitted to republish. Or that they can only republish in certain ways (e.g., only in print but not on a mobile app). Editors want to be able to:
					<dl>
					  <dt>Create a bundle of action and context"</dt>
						<dd>An editor identifies a content use in context, meaning a particular action they propose to take with pieces of content (e.g. "print", "distribute", "archive") and any relevant context for that action (e.g. location="France"). The types of context for an action correspond to possible constraints which could apply to the use of a piece of content. The use is not tied to one particular piece of content. The use must have a unique identifier. </dd>
					 <dt>Determine whether a use is permitted for a particular content item</dt>
					 <dd>At the point where an Editor wishes to use a particular piece of content in a particular way, the policies must be evaluated to determine whether it is permitted and whether there are any duties that must be fulfilled. The possible results are therefore: "yes", "no" or "maybe". </dd>
					 </dl>

					<!-- <li> <strong>Title</strong>:   </li> -->
					<p class="contributor">Phil Archer</p>
					<!--<li> <strong>Industry</strong>: Language resources industry </li>-->

					<p>The European Data Portal (EDP) harvests and republishes metadata from across Europe. It therefore has to handle a wide variety of inputs, including a variety of licenses attached to datasets (and datasets with no license attached). In order to manage this, the EDP has examined each of the most commonly found licenses and derived a set of atomic permissions and obligations expressed in those licenses with the intention that users can assess whether or not a particular combination of datasets is permissible and, if so, under what conditions. Their work itself is available on the <a class="external text" href="http://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/training-library/library/edp-reports">European Data Portal</a> as <strong>Licence Assistant: European Data Portal Licence Compatibility Matrix</strong>.

					<p>A bundled data product, which is sometimes called a 'base product', brings together a set of permissions that can be separately bought into a policy [or package] that is sold for a single price - or provided for free. It is important that the pricing is set at the aggregate level.

					<p class="contributor">V&iacute;ctor Rodr&iacute;guez-Doncel</p>
					<!--<li> <strong>Industry</strong>: Language resources industry </li>-->

					<p>Depending on the use case, it's often necessary to specify constraints on properties of different kinds of entities (e.g., assets, parties or any other external entities). The exact subject for which those constraints must hold is currently not encodable in ODRL, but has to be inferred from the textual semantics of each of ODRL's 25 constraint terms; which not only leads to ambiguities in terms of interpreted semantics, but might also prove to be not capable of fully covering new usages of ODRL.

				<h2><dfn>POE.UC.22</dfn>: Technical documents rules for business process regulatory compliance</h2>

					<!--<p class="contributor">Serena Villata (joint work with Guido Governatori) in the context of the MIREL Project</p>


							<p> Technical documents describe how to handle and what are the functionalities of a certain product or process (e.g., telecommunication codes). They are intended to provide information about what can/cannot be done with the product or within a certain process. Given the huge dimension of this kind of legal texts and their diffusion in the companies, the advantages of returning a machine-readable representation of such texts would allow to have in this representation a kind of summary of the main constraints expressed in the documents, with invaluable time saving for every person that is expected to read the whole document before obtaining this information. A specific usage of such a kind of texts is that of manually extracting the set of obliged/prohibited/permitted actions in order to check whether certain business processes are compliant with the legal text they should refer to. Moreover, issues related to the merging of updated versions of the documents, with amendments with respect to the policies and duties expressed in the former versions.

				<h2><dfn>POE.UC.24</dfn>: Synchronization in a multilayer music description environment </h2>

					<p class="contributor">Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale (LIM), Department of Computer Science, Universit&aacute; degli Studi di Milano</p>


							<p> IEEE 1599 is an international XML-based standard that aims to comprehensively describe music content by supporting the representation of heterogeneous music aspects within a single XML document. Moreover, IEEE 1599 lets spatio-temporal relationships emerge among such materials, thanks to the identification of music events inside a common data structure known as the spine: in this way, events can be described in different layers (e.g., a chord's graphical aspect and its audio performance), as well as multiple times within a single layer (e.g., different music performances of the same events). Consequently, the IEEE 1599 multilayer environment presents two complementary synchronization modes: inter-layer and intra-layer synchronization. Coupling these two categories of synchronization makes it possible to design and implement frameworks that allow new kinds of interaction with media contents and novel music-experience models, as shown in the Music Box area of the EMIPIU web framework (see URL above). Recognizing music events and their synchronization can be seen as an additional intellectual achievement that on one side does not affect the already existing IP rights on media contents, but on the other side requires adequate protection. Consequently, it is desirable to consider a new permission which allows the producer to synchronize different media contents with respect to the other possibly existing permissions, restrictions and duties associated with media contents.

				<h2><dfn>POE.UC.26</dfn>: Data Quality Policy </h2>

					<p class="contributor">Antoine Isaac, Riccardo Albertoni</p>


							<p> Example from the W3C Working Group Data on the Web Best Practices [dwbp], more specifically for the Data Quality Vocabulary [vocab-dqv]. This example specifies that the serviceProvider grants the permission to access the dataset and commits to serve the data with a certain quality, more concretely, 99% availability of a SPARQL endpoint associated with the dataset. This is expressed as a duty on the service provider with a constraint that is defined using a DQV metric (<code>:sparqlEndpointUptime</code>) that has to be greater than a certain value (e.g., 99). The <code>odrl:assignee</code> is the recipient of the policy statement and the <code>odrl:assigner</code> is the issuer of the policy statement. For discussion about this example see <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-odrl/2016Feb/0000.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-odrl/2016Feb/0000.html</a>
							</p>
							<p> The expression of constraints in ODRL seems quite unfit with expressing general constraints on values in RDF graphs, as we would require here. However, ODRL can be easily extended, and is schedule to undergo refinement in the context of the W3C Permissions & Obligations Expression Working Group. In the future DQV implementers should investigate whether a general constraint expression language like the coming SHACL provides a more appropriate mechanism to be used on top of ODRL permissions and duties. </p>

							<p> OCLC (Online Computer Library Center, Inc.) is an online library cooperative that seeks to catalog the world's library records in order to improve awareness of what books and other resources (electronic and print) are available in participating libraries globally. A better method for collecting information describing copyright ownership of and permissions on a given resource, and a standard set of rights data, including standard terms and clear definitions of those terms, is needed in order to provide consistent and accurate information regarding the permissions associated with the resources catalogued in libraries worldwide, including those currently in the WorldCat database and those that are incoming. Currently, rights and permissions information on catalogued materials is often inconsistent, inaccurate and/or incomplete.

					<p class="contributor">Julie Morris on behalf of the Book Industry Study Group (BISG)</p>


							<p> Currently, rights and permissions data is captured primarily at the book product level (typically using ONIX). Publishers large and small would like to take advantage of new content licensing opportunities for chapters, chunks, or other portions of the whole work (such as SharedBook) but often do not have sufficient permissions information to do so. A simple system for assigning permissions to chunks of content is needed, including a standard rights language used to collect permissions information from authors and publishers, along with a standard method for communicating permissions data that is machine-readable and travels with the content (in the EPUB or other electronic file, such as in the metadata embedded in an image file).

				<h2><dfn>POE.UC.31</dfn>: Improve internal rights management systems (large book publishers)</h2>

					<p class="contributor">Julie Morris on behalf of the Book Industry Study Group (BISG)</p>


							<p> Most large book publishers have developed their own internal databases/systems for managing rights and permissions information, but in many cases these systems have become out of date and insufficient for tracking the kinds of granular rights data needed to take advantage of new and forthcoming opportunities for content licensing. In addition, in many cases rights departments at large publishing houses are segmented from acquisitions and editorial departments, deepening the divide between the rights information collected for new works and that which is needed—digital assets are not always defined from the point of acquisition. A standard set of discrete permissions data including a variety of digital rights would provide an efficient system for publishers to begin collecting this information. Currently a large amount of revenue is left on the table because of insufficient knowledge of rights held, and lack of an efficient system for collecting and communicating permissions data that incorporates the breadth of licensing models available. A standardized model and vocabulary for expressing permissions and obligations information would facilitate both the management of content licensed from others and the monetization of content licensed to others. </p>
							<p>To be clear, this use case does not envision creating a standard for publishers to use as the sole basis for their internal databases/systems; rather, it envisions a standard way of ingesting and outputting rights and permissions information, with which publishers' internal databases should interoperate.</p>

				<h2><dfn>POE.UC.32</dfn>:  Improve efficiency of foreign rights transactions (University Press)</h2>

					<p class="contributor">Julie Morris on behalf of the Book Industry Study Group (BISG)</p>


							<p> A university press holds a large database of work, including books, journals, and other electronic resources, and regularly sub-licenses foreign and translations rights to international clients. The database is housed in an internal system but insufficient rights information exists due in part to the lack of a clear system for collecting and managing rights and permissions information. The UP needs a standard system for labeling rights held and rights sold/purchased in order to efficiently execute rights deals internationally. Consistency of contractual language terminology and meaning among international trading partners is key: rights language across internal database and clients' database is often misaligned. Additionally, many transactions are still done or initiated in person; these transactions are difficult to track because of database limitations—currently, status; interactions; and contacts for international rights transactions on a large number of titles gets lost.

This access is distinct from copyright held on the work and needs to be treated as such in metadata that is attached to a work.

							<p> Higher education curriculum service providers (e.g. e-textbook services) would like to be able to offer course instructors the ability to compose single textbook volumes (whether in print or ebook) from materials sourced from multiple publications from one publisher or  multiple publishers. For example, an instructor could assemble a custom physics textbook with a chapter on angular momentum from one publisher's textbook, friction from another publisher's textbook, gravity from another, etc., plus her own treatment of magnetic fields.  One of the reasons why no one has been able to offer a scalable service of this type is the difficulty of licensing content from multiple higher education publishers in a flexible and automated manner.
