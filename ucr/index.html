					<dfn>POE.UC.01</dfn>: Permissions and obligations for language resources</h2>
        <ul>
        <li> <strong>Title</strong>: Permissions and Obligations for Language Resources 
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Contributor</strong>: Víctor Rodríguez on behalf of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/community/ld4lt/">W3C Linked Data For Language Technology Community Group</a>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Industry</strong>: Language resources industry 
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Description</strong>: Language resources (lexicons, dictionaries, machine translation, etc.) are collected in repositories. Publishers would like to express what is permitted and what it is not.
        <p>Language resources are highly valuable resources now being massively translated to Linked Data. See the diagram here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://linghub.lider-project.eu/llod-cloud">Linguistic Linked Data Cloud</a>
        Different Language Resource Catalogs exist, like the one of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a>, or the one of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://metashare.elda.org/">META-SHARE</a>, LRMAP, Linghub, etc. 
        These resources need to be browswed and queried, and the permissions information must be in a machine-readable form in order to facilitate search-by-permission and in order to allow the automated processing of permission expressions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>POE requirements</strong>: 
        <ol>
        <li> All the requirements of ODRL
        </li>
        <li> A number of more precise <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/community/ld4lt/wiki/Metashare_vocabulary_for_licenses">requirements</a> can be found in the work within the Linked Data For Language Technologies (LD4LT) W3C Community Group. <br>
        In particular, these requirements were identified:
        </li>
        <li> Ability to represent who is the distribution rightsholder and who is the IPR holder of a certain language asset.

        </li>
        <li> Ability to express conditions based on the user nature (academic, commercial, etc.)
        </li>
        <li> Ability to express features on the distribution of the resource (physical, download, etc.)
        </li>
        <li> Ability to specify the condition to distribute derived material and the condition to create derived material
        </li>
        <li> Ability to specify a fee within and outside the POE expression

        <li> Ability to specify the further policy applicable in case certain conditions hold
