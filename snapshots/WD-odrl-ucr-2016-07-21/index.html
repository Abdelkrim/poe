    <p>This document includes a set of use cases and requirements, compiled by the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression (POE) working group, that motivate the expression of statements about digital content usage. All use cases provide realistic examples describing how people and organisations may (or want to be able to) specify statements about digital content usage. The requirements derived from these use cases will be used to guide the development of the POE WG recommendation deliverables for the Information Model, Vocabulary and Encodings. </p>

Each use case is identified by a reference number to aid cross-reference from other documentation.

            <p> A publisher of Linked Data (or in general a RDF dataset) wants to selectively make available parts (e.g. named graphs) of a dataset. Availability depend on ODRL policies, the context and the ODRL Request and ODRL Ticket. For example, given a dataset, one might want to serve it under the following conditions: "Anybody can access named graph ex:graph1, but can only access ex:graph2 during 2016. Individual triples in ex:graph3 can be accessed at the price of 1 eur cent."

Irrespective of the terms under which the paper is published (although usually open access), the data is generally expected to be made freely and openly available.

The purpose of the embargo period is to allow the researcher or research team creating the dataset to have a publication based on it published before colleagues can access the dataset and generate their own publications.

They are intended to provide information about what can/cannot be done with the product or within a certain process. Given the huge dimension of this kind of legal texts and their diffusion in the companies, the advantages of returning a machine-readable representation of such texts would allow to have in this representation a kind of summary of the main constraints expressed in the documents, with invaluable time saving for every person that is expected to read the whole document before obtaining this information. A specific usage of such a kind of texts is that of manually extracting the set of obliged/prohibited/permitted actions in order to check whether certain business processes are compliant with the legal text they should refer to.

            <p>The Research &amp; Education Space platform, developed jointly by the BBC and partners, indexes Linked Open Data describing media that is available both to the public, and specifically for those in formal education, primarily in the UK. Even within this latter group, there are a range of different licensing schemes and access mechanisms which are not mutually-exclusive. For queries against the index to return appropriate results for a user, we must track which schemes they (or their institution) is a member of and filter based upon these, which therefore translates into a requirement for the metadata being indexed to include information identifying which are applicable (we term these "audience URIs"). Note that this is not an access-control mechanism (this should be implemented and enforced at the media location), rather a means of ensuring that an optimal user experience is delivered.

            <p>In the news industry, rights holders and editors need to establish the permissions and restrictions associated with content.</p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>What Do Rights Holders Want?</dt>
              <dd> In general, rights holders will require that a set of permissions, restrictions, and duties be obeyed for a defined set of content. And they can require additional restrictions or duties for individual items within the larger content set. Rights holders wish to restrict the use of their content by factors such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>Geography (e.g. "No use in China")</li>
                  <li>Time (e.g. "No archive after 3 days")</li>
                  <li>Distribution channel (e.g. "No mobile")</li>
                </ul>
                They also want to enforce duties such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>Payment (e.g. "You can use this photo online for EUR80")</li>
                  <li>Attribution (e.g. "Credit Kyoto News")</li>
                </ul>
                Often, rights holders need to constrain the use of their content in complex ways, i.e., with combined constraints (e.g, "No use in UK after 7 days"). Generally, rights holders want to be able to:
                <dl>
                  <dt>Create a bundle of permissions, restrictions and duties</dt>
                  <dd>The rights holder creates a set of permissions and restrictions with constraints, together with any duties that the editor must perform, in order to unlock the permissions. The set may be associated with one or more sets of content. Therefore the policy bundle must have a unique identifier. </dd>
                  <dt>Identify one or more items of content to be treated as a set</dt>
                  <dd>The rights holder defines one or more content items which are to be treated as a set. The set must have a unique identifier.</dd>
                  <dt>Bind a policy to a set of content</dt>
                  <dd>The rights holder asserts that a given set of content is governed by a given policy. Note that a given content item might be a member of more than one set of content. Therefore, a given content item may have more than one policy associated with it. </dd>
                </dl>
              </dd>


              <!--</p>-->
              <dt>What Do Editors Want?</dt>
              <dd> Ideally, not to worry about rights at all. Essentially, editors want to know the answer to the question "Can I use this content in this way?" and, if the answer is yes, "Are there any duties?". It is not unusual for editors to have access to content that they are not permitted to republish. Or that they can only republish in certain ways (e.g., only in print but not on a mobile app). Editors want to be able to:
                <dl>
                  <dt>Create a bundle of action and context"</dt>
                  <dd>An editor identifies a content use in context, meaning a particular action they propose to take with pieces of content (e.g. "print", "distribute", "archive") and any relevant context for that action (e.g. location="France"). The types of context for an action correspond to possible constraints which could apply to the use of a piece of content. The use is not tied to one particular piece of content. The use must have a unique identifier. </dd>
                  <dt>Determine whether a use is permitted for a particular content item</dt>
                  <dd>At the point where an Editor wishes to use a particular piece of content in a particular way, the policies must be evaluated to determine whether it is permitted and whether there are any duties that must be fulfilled. The possible results are therefore: "yes", "no" or "maybe". </dd>
                </dl>
              </dd>

            <p>The European Data Portal (EDP) harvests and republishes metadata from across Europe. It therefore has to handle a wide variety of inputs, including a variety of licenses attached to datasets (and datasets with no license attached). In order to manage this, the EDP has examined each of the most commonly found licenses and derived a set of atomic permissions and obligations expressed in those licenses with the intention that reusers can assess whether or not a particular combination of datasets is permissible and, if so, under what conditions. Their work itself is available on the <a class="external text" href="http://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/training-library/library/edp-reports">European Data Portal</a> as <strong>Licence Assistant: European Data Portal Licence Compatibility Matrix</strong>.

            <p>Depending on the use case, it's often necessary to specify constraints on properties of different kinds of entities (e.g., assets, parties or any other external entities). The exact subject for which those constraints must hold is currently not encodable in ODRL, but has to be inferred from the textual semantics of each of ODRL's 25 constraint terms; which not only leads to ambiguities in terms of interpreted semantics, but might also prove to be not capable of fully covering new usages of ODRL.
