    <p>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for describing statements about content usage. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL statements. </p>
        <p>Policies are used to explicitly state what are the permitted and prohibited actions over a certain resource. In addition, policies may be integrated with complex constraints (e.g., time constraints) which apply to such actions to impose further restrictions to the uses of the resource. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>   

<p>Several business scenarios require to express what are the permitted and prohibited actions over  content. These permitted/prohibited actions are usually expressed under the form of policies, i.e., entities that allow to indicate those uses and re-uses of the content which are comform with the existing regulations or to the constraints assigned by the owner. Policies may also be enriched with additional information, i.e., who are the entities in charge of the definition of such Policy and those who are required to conform to it, what are the additional constrains to be associated with the Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties expressed by the Policy. The ability to express these concepts and relationships is important both for the producers of content, i.e., they may state in a clear way what are the permitted and the prohibited actions to prevent misuses, and for the consumers, i.e., they may know precisely how they are allowed to use and re-use the content to avoid breaking the law or the owner's constraints. This specification describes a common approach to expressing these concepts, and more.</p>
<p>The ODRL Information Model defines the underlying semantic model for permission and obligation statements describing content usage. The information model covers the core concepts, entities and relationships that provide the foundational model for content usage statements. These machine-readable policies may be linked directly with the content they are associated to with the aim to allow consumers to easily retrieve those information.</p>
     
<section id="aimsModel">
<h3>Aims of the Model</h3>

<p>The primary aim of the ODRL Information Model is to provide a standard description model and format to express permission and obligation statements to be associated to content in general. These permission and obligation statements are employed to describe the terms of use and reuse of  resources. The model should cover as many Permission and Obligation use cases as possible, while keeping the policy modeling easy even when dealing with complex uses.</p>

<p>The ODRL Information Model is a single, consistent model that can be used by all interested parties. All efforts have been made to keep the implementation costs for both content producers and consumers to a minimum. A single method of fulfilling a use case is strongly preferred over multiple methods, unless there are existing standards that need to be accommodated or there is a significant cost associated with using only a single method. While the Information Model is built using Linked Data principles, the design is intended to allow non-graph-based implementations also. </p>

<h2>Relationship to the W3C ODRL Community Group Reports</h2>

    
<p>The basis for the deliverables for the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group are the reports created by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a>. The ODRL Community Group has developed a family of specifications to support innovative expression of  asset usage for the publication, distribution and consumption of content services.
The final outputs of the ODRL Community Group were the ODRL Version 2.1 specifications that were a major update for ODRL and superseded the original ODRL Version 1.1 [[odrl]] (published as a W3C NOTE).</p>
    
<p>The following documents are part of the ODRL Community Group report series:</p>
<ul>
<li>ODRL V2 Requirements [[odrl2-req]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Core Model [[odrl21-model]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Common Vocabulary [[odrl21-vocab]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 XML Encoding [[odrl21-xml]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Ontology [[odrl21-onto]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 JSON Encoding [[odrl21-json]]</li>
</ul>

 <p>
The ODRL Information Model was derived from the ODRL V2.1 Core Model Community Group report. Details of the differences between the W3C Working Group deliverables and the ODRL Community Group Reports are maintained in the <a href="#community">Appendix</a>. All new ODRL implementations are expected to use the deliverables of the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group. </p>

<section id="infoModel">
<h2>ODRL Information Model</h2>

    <p>The ODRL Information Model enables Policies to express Permissions and Prohibitions related to the usage of Assets. In essence, this explicitly expresses what is allowed and what is not allowed by the Policy, as well as other requirements and parties involved. The aim of the ODRL Information Model is to support flexible Policy expressions by allowing the author to include as much, or as little, expressive detail.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the ODRL Information Model. The Policy is the central entity that holds an ODRL policy together. </p>

<figure>
	<img src="fig/00Model.svg" alt="ODRL Information Model" width="800"/>
    <figcaption>ODRL Information Model</figcaption>
</figure>

  
    
<p>The ODRL Information Model diagram shows the Permission, Prohibition and Duty classes as subclasses of the abstract Rule concept. These Rules have common relationships to the other key concepts (specifically, Action, Asset, Party, and Constraint). However, there are core differences in their semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Permission indicates that the Policy expresses an Action that MAY be performed,</li>
<li>A Prohibition indicates that the Policy expresses an Action that MUST NOT be performed, and</li>
<li>A Duty indicates that the Policy expresses an Action that MUST be performed (as a requirement to be granted a Permission). </li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, a Permission in a Policy MAY allow a particular Action to be applied to an Asset, e.g., &#8220;play the audio file abc.mp3&#8221;. A Constraint, such as &#8220;at most 10 times&#8221;, MAY be added to express limitations to the Actions. The Party "VirtualMusicShop" that granted this Permission MAY be included with the Role Assigner, and the Party "Alice" that is granted the Permission MAY be included with the Role Assignee.</p>
<p>Similar to Permissions, a Duty states that a certain Action MUST be executed by the Party with the Role Assignee for the Permission to be valid, e.g. &#8220;Alice must pay 5 Euros in order to get the Permission to play abc.mp3&#8243;.</p>

<section id="policy">
<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>The Policy entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the identification of the Policy entity (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>type</code>: indicates the specific type of the Policy entity (REQUIRED).</li>
<li><code>conflict</code>: indicates how to handle Policy conflicts (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>undefined</code>: indicates how to handle undefined Actions (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>inheritAllowed</code>: indicates if the Policy entity can be inherited (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>profile</code>: the identifier of the ODRL Profile that this Policy conforms to (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>

<p>The values for the Policy entity&#8217;s <code>type</code> attribute are described in the ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or in ODRL Profiles. The Policy <code>type</code> describes the context of use of the Policy and MAY include additional constraints that processing systems MUST understand. For example, the "Agreement" Policy type stipulates minimal cardinalities for some for the Information Model entities, which are different than the "Offer" Policy type. In addition, and more importantly, the "Agreement" Policy type expresses that the Permissions/Prohibitions have been granted, but the "Offer" Policy type does not.</p>

<p>To illustrate the concepts described in the Information Model, we will start from basic examples to come to more sophisticated ones when concepts are discussed in more details. </p>
 

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The below "Set" Policy type grants the Permission to read and the Prohibition to reproduce the target Asset http//example.com/asset:9898. No Parties or other elements are involved.</p>

}

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The below "Set" Policy type states that the Asset http//example.com/asset:9898 is the target of the Permission to perform the action reproduce, the Duty to perform the action attribute to http://example.com/owner:9898, and the Prohibition to perform the action translate. Two Parties are involved, namely the Assigner of the Permission and the Party to be attributed.</p>

<section id="structure">
<h4>Policy Structures</h4>
             
    <p>The ODRL Information Model supports flexibility in the information structures to declare ODRL expressions. A Policy MAY contain multiple Rules, and each Rule MAY contain multiple Assets, Parties, Actions, Constraints, and Duties. A Policy MAY also contain Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level, and these apply to all of the enclosing Rules in the Policy.</p>
     
     <p>At the core <i>atomic</i> level, an ODRL Rule (Permission and/or Prohibition) would typically contain one Asset, one or more Parties, one Action, and potentially one Constraint and/or Duty, as shown in the example below:</p>
             
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
    },
    "type": "odrl:Agreement",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
    }]
}  
</pre>

<p>As multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions are support for each Rule, then the following (snippet) example with two Assets:</p>
    
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "target": "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
</pre>

<p>Would then be mapped to two <i>atomic</i> Rules:</p>
    
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
</pre>
    
    <p>The processing model for Permission/Prohibition Rules with multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions to generate <i>atomic</i> Rules includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>If there are multiple Assets (with the same Relation), then create new Rules (one for each Asset) and include one Asset relation, and all the other (non-Asset) entities.</li>
    <li>If there are multiple Parties (with the same Role), then create new Rules (one for each Party) and include one Party Role, and all the other (non-Party Role) entities.</li>
    <li>If there are multiple Actions, then create new Rules (one for each Action) and include one Action, and all the other (non-Action) entities.</li>
    </ol>
       
    <p>An ODRL Policy MAY also declare multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level. This indicates that these are all common to all the enclosing Rules, as shown in the below example:</p>
             
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
    },
    "type": "odrl:Agreement",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
    "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
    "action": "odrl:play",
    "permission": [{
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy"
        }]
    }]
}  
</pre>

<p>To fully expand the Rules, the Policy-level Assets, Parties, and Actions MUST be added to all the Rules in the Policy. As shown below, the policy-level Target, Assigner, and Action are added to the two permission Rules:</p>
    
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
    },
    "type": "odrl:Agreement",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy"
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        }]
    }]
}  
</pre>  
    
       <p>The processing model for Policies with multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Assets in the enclosing Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
   <li>Replicate all Policy-level Parties in the enclosing Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Actions in the enclosing Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
      <li>Follow the processing model (defined above) to create <i>atomic</i> Rules.</li>  
    </ol>
       
    
    
    </section>
             
     <section id="provenace">
<h4>Policy Provenance</h4>
         
       <p>Provenance attributes MAY be added to the Policy entity to support additional authenticity, integrity, and interpretation. Typically, these will be from external community vocabularies. </p>
         
         <p>The following Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[!DCTERMS]] SHOULD be used:</p>
            <ul>
         <li>dc:creator - the individual, agent, or organisation that authored the Policy.</li>
         <li>dc:issued - the date (and time) the Policy was first issued.</li>
         <li>dc:modified -  the date (and time) the Policy was updated.</li>
        <li>dc:coverage -  the jurisdiction under which the Policy is relevant.</li>
        <li>dc:replaces -  the identifier (uid) of a Policy that this Policy supersedes.</li>
        <li>dc:isReplacedBy -  the identifier (uid) of a Policy that supersedes this Policy.</li>

    <p>The processing model for Policies with the above provenance properties include:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>If a Policy contains the <B>dc:isReplacedBy</B> property, then the identified Policy MUST be retrieved and processed.</li>
    </ol>

    <section id="conflict">
<h4>Policy Conflict</h4>
        
<p>The <code>conflict</code> attribute is used to establish strategies to resolve conflicts that arise from the merging of Policies or conflicts between Permissions and Prohibitions in the same Policy. Conflicts may arise when merging Policies about the same Asset and the resultant Actions are inconsistent. For example, one Policy stated that Assignee Fred had been granted an "exclusive" distribution Permission, and the other Policy said the same for Assignee Mary. In the same Policy, conflicts can also arise when the same Action is used in a Permission and a Prohibition. </p>
    
    <p>The <code>conflict</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perm</code>: the <code>Permission</code>s MUST override the Prohibitions</li>
<li><code>prohibit</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code>s MUST override the Permissions</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the entire Policy MUST be invalid if any conflict is detected</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>conflict</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>invalid</code> will be used.</p>

        
<p>The processing model for Policies conflict strategies includes:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> attribute of <code>perm</code> and there are detected conflicts between a Permission and a Prohibition, then the Permission MUST overide the Prohibition.</li>
 <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> attribute of <code>prohibit</code> and there are detected conflicts between a Permission and a Prohibition, then the Prohibition MUST overide the Permission.</li>
  <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> attribute of <code>invalid</code> and there are detected conflicts between a Permission and a Prohibition, then the entire Policy MUST be processed as invalid .</li> 
 <li>If a Policy has multiple <code>conflict</code> attribute values (for example, after a Policy merge) AND there are detected conflicts between a Permission and a Prohibition, then the entire Policy MUST be processed as invalid .</li> 
    </ol>
       
        
	
<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: Two Policies are associated to the same target Asset http://example.com/asset:1212. The first Policy http://example.com/policy:0001 allows to use the Asset. The second Policy http://example.com/policy:0002 allows for the display of the Asset, but it prohibits print. Both policies explicitly state how to deal with conflicts through the <code>conflict</code> attribute being set to <code>perm</code>. Hence the Permissions will always override any Prohibitions. In this use case, since the print Action is a subset of the use Action, there could be a conflict. However, the <code>perm</code> conflict strategy means that the use Permission will override the print Prohibition.</p>

    <section id="undefined">
<h4>Undefined Actions</h4>
    
<p>The <code>undefined</code> attribute is used to indicate how to process unsupported Actions. That is, if an ODRL expression contains an Action that is not from a known (or supported) ODRL vocabulary, how should the Action be treated in the context of the whole ODRL Policy?</p>
        
 <p>The <code>undefined</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>support</code>: the undefined Action is to be <b>supported</b> as part of the Policy &#8211; and the Policy remains valid</li>
<li><code>ignore</code>: the undefined Action is to be <b>ignored</b> and is not part of the Policy &#8211; and the Policy remains valid</li>
    <li><code>invalid</code>: the undefined Action is unknown &#8211; and the entire Policy is <b>invalid</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, systems that process ODRL expressions SHOULD provide mechanisms that adequately address these three outcomes. That is, how the Action can be <b>supported</b>, or <b>ignored</b>, or the entire Policy is <b>invalid</b>. </p>


        <p>If the <code>undefined</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>invalid</code> SHALL be used.</p>
        
                
<p>The processing model for undefined actions includes:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>If a Policy has the <code>undefined</code> attribute of <code>support</code> and there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the processing system MUST support these actions as part of the valid Policy.</li>
    <li>If a Policy has the <code>undefined</code> attribute of <code>ignore</code> and there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the processing system MUST disregard these actions as part of the valid Policy.</li>
    <li>If a Policy has the <code>undefined</code> attribute of <code>invalid</code> and there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the processing system MUST process the entire Policy as invalid.</li>
     <li>If a Policy has multiple <code>undefined</code> attribute values (for example, after a Policy merge) AND there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the entire Policy MUST be processed as invalid.</li> 
    </ol>
       
        
        
        

  <p><b>Example Use Case</b>: A Policy of type Set states that the Asset can be <i>recorded</i>. The processing system does not understand this Action, and since the <b>undefined</b> attribute is <b>invalid</b>, then the entire Policy is deemed invalid.</p>

<section id="inhertiance">
<h4>Policy Inheritance</h4>

    <p>ODRL supports a simple inheritance mechanism in which a (child) Policy may inherit all the information structures of another (parent) Policy. The inheritance is aimed at <i>including</i> data structures between Policies.</p>
    
<p>The <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute in the Policy entity is used to indicate if the Policy expression can be used in any inheritance relationship. If present, the value of the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code>: the Policy expression can be used for inheritance</li>
<li><code>false</code>: the Policy expression can not be used for inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>true</code> will be used.</p>
<p>The following attributes SHOULD be used in a child Policy that is inheriting from a parent Policy in which that parent Policy MUST allow inheritance (via the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute) :</p>

    <ul>
    <li><code>inheritFrom</code>: the identifier of the parent Policy from which this child Policy inherits from</li>
<li><code>inheritRelation</code>: the identifier of the relationship context of this inheritance structure</li>
    </ul>
    
    
<p>The <code>inheritFrom</code> association in the (child) Policy will uniquely identify (via a UID) the (parent) Policy from which the inheritance will be performed.</p>
<p>The <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute in the (child) Policy will uniquely identify (via a UID) the context of inheritance from the (parent) Policy. For example, this may indicate the business scenario, such as <em>subscription</em>, or prior arrangements between the Parties (that are not machine representable). Such terms SHOULD be defined in the ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or ODRL Profiles. For example, an Assigner and Assignee may have a historical arrangement related to the specific use of content they make available to each other. The business model (identified with a URI) is used in the <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute in their subsequent ODRL Policies they exchange. This will require the ODRL Policy to be interpreted with the additional information identified by the URI. For example, this may include additional permission Actions or constraints (etc) that is documented in their business model arrangement.</p>
<p>Both the <code>inheritFrom</code> association and <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute may be used independently.</p>
    
<p>The following restrictions apply when using inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single inheritance is only supported. (One parent Policy to one or more child Policy entities. No child Policy can inherit from two or more parent Policy entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance can be to any depth. (Multiple levels of children Policy entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance MUST NOT be circular.</li>
<li>No state information is transferred from the parent Policy to the child Policy.</li>
</ul>
	
<p><b>Example Use Case:</b>Consider the below (parent) Policy that has been expressed primarly for inheritance purposes:</p>    
    
    <pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"

    "permission": [{
        "action": "odrl:use"
    }]
}  
</pre>
    
<p>The below (child) Policy includes the inheritFrom attribute pointing to the above (parent) Policy. The (child) Policy also includes its own specific policy-level asset, and two Permission Rules.</p>    
    
    <pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">

    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"

        "action": "odrl:print"
    }]
}  
</pre>
    

<p>After the inheritance is performed - where the (parent) Policy information structures are added to the (child) Policy - the resultant Policy is shown below:</p>    
    
    <pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {

    "permission": [{
        "action": "odrl:use"
    }]
}  
</pre>
    
   
    
<p>The processing model for ODRL Policy Inheritance includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>A (child) Policy with an <code>inheritFrom</code> attribute MUST first verify that the (parent) Policy does not contain the <code>inhertiAllowed</code> attribute with the value "false".</li>
        <li>The (child) Policy MUST access the (parent) Policy and replicate the following in the (child) Policy:</li>
       <ul>
           <li>All policy-level Assets, Parties, Actions.</li>
           <li>All Permission and Prohibition Rules.</li>
       </ul>
      <li>The (child) Policy can then be further expanded (into <i>atomic</i> Rules) by following the processing models defined in the <a href="#structure">Policy Structure</a> section.</li>  
    </ol>

</section>

<section id="asset">
<h3>Asset</h3>
<p>The Asset entity is the subject of an ODRL policy expression that Permissions and Prohibitions are applied to. The Asset entity can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, or services. Furthermore, it can be used to represent other <code>Asset</code> entities that are needed to undertake the Policy expression, such as with the Duty entity. The Asset entity is referred to by the Permission and/or Prohibition entities, and also by the Duty entity.</p>
<p>The Asset entity contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the Asset (REQUIRED)</li>
    <li><code>scope</code>: defines how the Asset shall be interpreted under different contexts. (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The identification of the Asset entity is a key foundation of the ODRL Policy language. In general, the <code>uid</code> SHOULD be a URI [[rfc3986]] representing the identifier for the Asset. There MAY also be other alternative identifers, or identification mechanisms that could be used. For example, to identify specific parts of an Asset, Media Fragments URI [[media-frags]] may be utilised. To identify groups or a range of Assets, then POWDER [[powder-primer]], URI Templates [[rfc6570]], or URI wildcards may be utilised. <p>
    
    <p>There are some use cases where the ODRL Policy expression MAY be embedded inside the target Asset. In these cases, it MAY be more appropriate to provide, or infer, a link to the Asset entity (as the complete Asset <code>uid</code> may not be known at the time) through the local context. Use of such inference and context MUST be documented in the relevant ODRL Profile.</p>
<p>Since ODRL Policies could deal with any kind of asset, the ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata to describe Asset entities of particular media types. It is recommended to use already existing metadata standards, such as <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/" rel="external nofollow">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> that are appropriate to the Asset type or purpose.</p>


<section id="relation">
<h4>Relation</h4>

<p>The Relation entity is an association class and can be used to link to an Asset from either Permission, Duty or Prohibition, indicating how the Asset SHOULD be utilised in respect to the entity that links to it.</p>
<p>The Relation entity contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>relation</code>: indicates the relationship of the Asset to the linked entity (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value for the <code>relation</code> attribute is <code>target</code> which indicates that the Asset is the primary object to which the Permission, Duty or Prohibition actions apply.</p>
    
<p>Other values for the Relation entity SHOULD be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>
</section>
	
<section id="asset-scope">
<h4>Scope</h4>
    
    <p>The <code>scope</code> attribute SHOULD be used to indicate the context under which to interpret the Asset entity. The purpose of <code>scope</code> is to provide additional information about the Asset. For example, the Asset identifier may refer to a resource which many characteristics, but the scope may limit that to only one specific characteristic.</p>
    
<p>The <code>scope</code> attribute URI values SHOULD be defined in the ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>

<h3>Party</h3>
    
<p>The Party entity is the object of an ODRL Policy and can be any form of identifiable entity, such as a person, group of people, organisation, or agent. An agent is a person or thing that takes an active Role or produces a specified effect. The Party performs (or does not perform) Actions or has a function in a Duty (i.e., assigns the Party to the Rule by associating it with the Role it plays in the Rule).</p>
    
<p>The Party entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the Party (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>function</code>: defines the Roles fulfilled by a Party in relation to a Rule (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>scope</code>: defines how the Role shall be interpreted under different contexts. (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata for the Party element. It is recommended to use already existing metadata standards, such as the W3C vCard Ontology [[vcard-rdf]] or FOAF [[foaf]], that are appropriate to the Party type or purpose.</p>
<p>The Role entity is used to associate the Party entity with the relevant Permission, Prohibition, and Duty entities.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>function</code>: the functional role the Party takes (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>function</code> attribute MUST support the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>assigner</code>: indicates that the Party has assigned the associated Permission, Duty, or Prohibition. In other words, the Party grants a Permission or requires a Duty to be performed or states a Prohibition.</li>
<li><code>assignee</code>: indicates that the Party has been assigned the associated entity, i.e., they are granted a Permission or required to perform a Duty or have to adhere to a Prohibition.</li>

<h3>Permission</h3>


<p>The Permission entity indicates the Actions permitted to be performed on the Asset.</p>
<p>An ODRL policy expression MAY contain at least one Permission. It is important to verify the semantics of the Policy <code>type</code> attribute as this SHOULD indicate additional constraints on the Policy expression semantics.</p>

<p>The Permission entity has the following relations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Asset</code>: the Permission entity MUST refer to an Asset (where at least one, and only one, <code>relation</code> value is <code>target</code>) on which the linked Action SHOULD be performed (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>Action</code>: the Permission entity MUST refer to <em>exactly one</em> Action that indicates the granted operation on the target Asset (REQUIRED) (Note: this is after the Rule has folowed the processing models defined in the <a href="#structure">Policy Structure</a> section.)</li>
<li><code>Party</code>: the Permission MAY refer to one or more Party entities linked via the Role entity (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>Constraint</code>: the Permission MAY refer to one or more Constraints which affect the validity of the Permission - it only becomes effective if all of the referred Constraints are true (OPTIONAL). For example; the Action play is only permitted for a certain period of time.</li>
<li><code>Duty</code>: the Permission MAY refer to one or more Duty entities that indicate a requirement that SHOULD be fulfilled in return for receiving the Permission (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
	
<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The ticket Policy expresses the play Permission for the target Asset http//example.com/game:9090, stating that the ticket is valid until the end of the year 2016. Any valid holder of this ticket may exercise this Permission.</p>

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The owner and Assigner of a target Asset http://example.com/photoAlbum:55 needs an Agreement Policy expressing with both a Permission and a Prohibition. Then Assigner Party http://example.com/MyPix:55 assigns the Permission display to the Assignee Party http://example.com/assignee:55 at the same time they are prohibited from archiving the target Asset. Additionally, in case of any conflict between Permissions and Prohibitions, the conflict attribute is set to <code>perm</code> indicating that the Permission entity will take precedence.</p>

<h3>Duty</h3>

<p>A Permission entity MAY include a Duty entity that indicates a requirement that MUST be satisfied in order to undertake the Permission. A Duty MUST only be associated with a Permission. </p>
    
    <p>The Duty entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: a unique identification for this Duty. Used to refer a single Duty to multiple Permission entities (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Duty</code> entity has the following relations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Action</code>: indicates the requirement that MUST be performed (REQUIRED). Note: It is assumed that the assigned Party has the appropriate permissions to perform this action.</li>
<li><code>Party</code>: a Duty MAY refer to Party entities with different Roles. If no explicit Party is linked to as Assignee or Assigner, the Parties with the respective Roles are taken from the referring Permission. (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>Asset</code>: a Duty entity MAY refer to an Asset (where at least one, and only one, <code>relation</code> value is <code>target</code>) related to satisfying the Duty. (OPTIONAL) For example, a <code>nextPolicy</code> Action must be linked to the identifier of a target Policy Asset.</li>

    <li><code>Constraint</code>: a Duty MAY refer to one or more Constraints which affect the fulfillment of the Duty - it is only fulfilled if all of the referred Constraints are true (OPTIONAL). For example; the Duty Action payAmount is only fulfilled if a specific amount is paid.
</li>
       
</ul>
    
    <p>If a Permission refers to several Duty entities, <em>all of them</em> MUST be satisfied for the Permission to be undertaken. If several Permission entities refer to one Duty, then the Duty only has to be satisfied <em>once</em> for all the Permission entities.</p>
    
<p>Even though a Duty entity is mandatory, the ODRL model does not specify any conditions on <em>WHEN</em> the Duty Action MUST be performed. Such business rules MAY be expressed through additional Constraints.  For example, a Policy may state that you can play a music file for a payment of $5.00. This does not indicate when the $5.00 should be paid, as different business rules may apply such as montly invoicing.</p>
    
<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The Party http://example.com/assigner:sony makes and Offer to play the music file http://example.com/music/1999.mp3. There are two Duties that both must be satisfied for the <code>compensate</code> requirement. The first is the <code>payAmount</code> of $AUD5.00 and the second is the <code>event</code> of this http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/policyUsage must not have occured yet.

<h3>Action</h3>


<p>The Action entity (when related to a Permission entity) indicates the operations (e.g., <code>play</code>, <code>copy</code>, etc.) that the Assignee (i.e., the consumer) is <em>permitted</em> to perform on the related Asset linked to by Permission. When related to a Prohibition, the Action entity indicates the operations that the Assignee (again the consumer) is <em>prohibited</em> to perform on the Asset linked to by Prohibition. Analogously, when related to a Duty, it indicates the operation to be performed.</p>
<p>Action contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: indicates the Action entity term (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>As its value, the <code>name</code> attribute SHOULD take one of a set of Action <em>names</em> which are formally defined in Profiles. The ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] defines a standard set of potential terms that MAY be used. Communities will develop new (or extend existing) Profiles to capture additional and refined semantics.</p>

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The Party needs to define an Offer policy granting a Permission about the target Asset http://example.com/music:1012, namely the permission to play the Asset.</p>

<h3>Constraint</h3>
    
    <p>The Constraint entity can be used to define restrictions to the Permission, the Prohibition and the Duty actions. Constraints are a logical expression for comparing two operands by one operator. If the logical expression evalutes to <b>true</b> the result of the Constraint is satisfied.</p>
        <p>
       Constraints can express limitations with logical comparisions. For example, the number of usages (<code>leftOperand</code>) must be smaller than (<code>operator</code>) the number 10 (<code>rightOperand</code>). Constraints can also be used for complex Constraint Relations expressions that use two constraint objects as the left and right operand. For example, Constraint #1 (<code>leftOperand</code>) must be satisfied or (<code>operator</code>) Constraint #2 (<code>rightOperand</code>) must be satisfied.</p>
 
    <p>Constraints MUST be checked by processings system at the time of executing the relevant action. If the constraint is satisfied (ie the logical expression is true) then the action becomes valid for the enclosing Rule. If the constraint is not satisfied, then the action is not valid for the enclosing Rule.</p>
    
    <p>The constraint <code>leftOperand</code> MUST clearly be defined to indicate which entity is the subject of the constraint, and MAY include how the value for comparison has to be retrieved or generated. For example, the <code>count</code> constraint applies to the <code>action</code> and the <code>language</code> constraint applies to the <code>asset</code>.</p>
       
<p>If multiple Constraint entities are linked to the same Permission, Prohibition, or Duty entity, then all the Constraint entities within the Rule MUST be satisfied. That is, all the Constraint entities are (boolean) <em>and</em>ed together. If the same Constraint is repeated within the same Rule, then these Constraints MUST be represented as a single Constraint entity using an appropriate <code>operator</code> value (for example, <code>isAnyOf</code>).</p>
       
<p>The <code>Constraint</code> entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>leftOperand</code>: the left operand of the Constraint entity (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>operator</code>: an operator function (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>rightOperand</code>: the right operand of the Constraint entity (REQUIRED if no rightOperandReference)</li>
<li><code>rightOperandReference</code>: the right operand of the Constraint entity (REQUIRED if no rightOperand)</li>
<li><code>dataType</code>: the datatype of the rightOperand (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>unit</code>: the units of the rightOperand (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>status</code>: the current value generated from the leftOperand action (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
        
<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>leftOperand</code> identifies the left operand of the logic expression for the Constraint. The <code>leftOperand</code> MAY be one of the Constraint Left Operands defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or from an ODRL Profile. In case of a Constraint Relations expression, the <code>leftOperand</code> MUST refer to a complete Constraint object (see <a href="#constraint-relations">Constraint Relations</a> for further requirements).
        </p>
    
<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>operator</code> identifies the logical operation such as &#8220;greater than&#8221; or &#8220;equal to&#8221 between the left and right operand. In case of a Constraint Relations expression the operator identifiers the logic relationship of two constraints using operators like 'and' or 'exclusive or'.</p>

<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>rightOperand</code> identifies the right operand of the logic expression for the Constraint. The <code>rightOperand</code> MAY be the value of the constraint that is to be compared to the <code>leftOperand</code>. The <code>rightOperand</code> represents the literal value (such as "10" or "http://example.com/c100") and <code>rightOperandReference</code> represents a URI that MUST be dereferenced to obtain the actual value. Only one between <code>rightOperand</code> and <code>rightOperandReference</code> MUST appear in the Constraint. In case of a Constraint Relations expression, the <code>rightOperand</code> MUST refer to an complete Constraint object (see <a href="#constraint-relations">Constraint Relations</a> for further requirements).</p>
        
<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>dataType</code> indicates the type of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as &#8220;decimal&#8221; or &#8220;xsd:datetime&#8221; and the <code>unit</code> indicates the unit value of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as &#8220;EU dollars&#8221;. In case of a Constraint Relations expression, the <code>dataType</code> attribute MUST NOT be used.</p>

        
<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>status</code> provides the current value generated from the <code>leftOperand</code> action. For example, a <code>count</code> constraint could have a <code>rightOperand</code> value of 10, and the <code>status</code> of 5. This means that the action has alread been exercised 5 times. In case of a Constraint Relations expression, the <code>status</code> attribute MUST NOT be used.</p>

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The Party http://example.com/myPix:6161 wants to assign the Permission distribute directly to the potential buyer of the Permission who will pay 100 EUR to be granted with the Permission. The distribute Permission is constrained to a specific country. The potential Assignee may then distribute the target Asset http://example.com/wallpaper:1234 according to the nextPolicy target Asset linked directly from this Permission. The next Policy Asset http://example.com/policy:7171 stipulates that the potential Assignee may only offer the display Permission to downstream consumers.</p>

    <h3>Constraint Relations</h3>
 
    <p>Constraint objects MAY also be used as both of the values for the <code>leftOperand</code> and <code>rightOperand</code> of a Constraint expression. This supports more complex Constraint Relations and allows for two constraints to be compared and processed accordingly. The two constraints MUST be <i>atomic</i> Constraints, that is, not a constraint that includes other Constraint Relations.</p>
    
    <p>The applicable <code>operators</code> that can be used for Constraint Relations are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>or</code> -  at least one of the Constraints (in the left or right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>xor</code> - only one of the Constraints (in the left or right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>and</code> - both of the Constraints (in the left and right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>isNecessaryFor</code> - both of the Constraints (in the left and right operand) MUST be satisfied AND the left operand Constraints is a prerequisite for the right operand Constraint.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <code>isNecessaryFor</code> operator is an example where there are potential conditional requirements between atomic Constraint expressions. This may lead to situations where the outcome is unresolvable, such as "deadlock" if an unsatisfiable Constraint expressions is a prerequisite for other Constraint expressions, or "recursive chaining" if a Constraint expression is referred to many times in numerous Constraint Relations on both operands.</p>
    
    
<p>The processing model for Constraint Relations includes:</p>
    <ol>
       <li>If the Constraint <code>leftOperand</code> refers to a Constraint object, then the <code>rightOperand</code> MUST also refer to a Constraint object.</li>
       <li>The Constraint objects both MUST be <i>atomic</i> Constraint expressions.</li>
        <li>The Constraint <code>operator</code> MUST only be of the values; <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>isNecessaryFor</code>. Other values MAY be defined in ODRL Profiles exclusively for the use of Constraint Relations.</li>
        <li>The Constraint MUST not use the <code>rightOperandReference</code>, <code>dataType</code>, <code>unit</code>, or <code>status</code> attributes.</li>
       <li>If the Constraint <code>operator</code> is <code>or</code> then at least one of the Constraints (in the left or right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Constraint to be satisfied.</li> 
        <li>If the Constraint <code>operator</code> is <code>xor</code> then at only one of the Constraints (in the left or right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Constraint to be satisfied.</li>  
        <li>If the Constraint <code>operator</code> is <code>and</code> then both of the Constraints (in the left and right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Constraint to be satisfied.</li>
        <li>If the Constraint <code>operator</code> is <code>isNecessaryFor</code> then the left operand Constraint MUST be satisfied then the right operand Constraint MUST be processed. The right operand Constraint MUST then be satisifed for the entire Constraint to be satisfied.</li>
        <li>If a Constraint expression (either in the left or right operand) is unsatisfiable AND is required to be satisfied (at some point), then the processing system MUST indicate an appropriate warning message.</li>
        <li>If the same Constaint expression appears as a left and/or right operand in different Constraint Relations, then the processing system MUST determine if that results in an unsatisfiable chain of Constraint expressions, and MUST indicate an appropriate warning message. </li>
    </ol>

<h2>ODRL Profiles</h2>

    <section id="profile-motivation">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
        
<p>The ODRL Information Model serves as a framework to express Policies and the ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] provides a broad range of common actions for Permissions, Prohibition, Duties as well as Policy Types, Constraint names, Asset relations, and Party roles. For communities that implement ODRL, the entire ODRL Information Framework and the entire Vocabulary would be too onerous when they will typically have very specific needs, as well as needs not covered by the ODRL vocabulary. </p>
<p>In these common cases, it is strongly recommended that a community create and formally document an ODRL Profile. An ODRL Profile will directly serve the communities needs by excluding features of the ODRL Information Model that they do not require (for example, inheritance) and specifying only the terms of the ODRL Vocabulary they wish to support. In addition, the ODRL Profile may include additional vocabulary terms specific to their community.</p>
        <p>The ODRL Profile may also include specific implementation details on how to determine the status and processing of Rules and Constraints. For example, the ODRL Profile may require the use of a thrid-party time-service to ensure temporal constraints are meet correctly (and will document the API details etc), or document the API to access values that need to be compared to the ODRL expression values (such as what location is the asset currently being used in).</p>

    <section id="profile-requirements">
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
      
<p>
    The <code>profile</code> attribute in the <code>Policy</code> entity is used to indicate the identifier (URI) of the ODRL Profile for which the Policy expression conforms to. This attribute is OPTIONAL, but if the attribute appears, then any consuming system MUST understand the identified ODRL Profile and all the constraints in the ODRL Profile MUST apply to the Policy expression. If a consuming system does not understand the ODRL Profile URI, then it MAY continue processing the Policy expression, but it SHOULD NOT assume it has interpreted the Policy expression correctly. </p>
    
    <p>If multiple ODRL Profiles are required, then it is recommended that a new identifier SHOULD be created to identify the combination of Profiles (and document the combined Profiles).</p>
<p>
The requirements for communities developing ODRL Profiles MUST document the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Any additions to the Information Model</li>
<li>Any cardinality changes to the Information Model</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that will have different default values or (editorial) interpretations</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that is not being supported</li>
<li>New Vocabulary terms</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms not explicitly being suported</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms with more specific interpretations</li>
<li>The ODRL Profile identifier (URI)</li>
    </ul>
  
<p>The community SHOULD also create a machine-readable schema for their ODRL Profile following the appropriate serialisations options outlined in the ODRL Vocabulary and Expression specification [[!vocab-odrl]]. In this case, the ODRL Profile URI MUST also be used as the serialisation namespace URI.</p>

<p>It is also recommended to share the ODRL Profile with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a> for feedback and comments. In addition, the W3C ODRL Community Group may host the ODRL Profile documents on their website. </p>

    <h3>Profile Examples</h3>
<p>
An example ODRL Profile - called RightsML [[rights-ml]] was developed by the <a href="https://www.iptc.org">International Press and Telecommuncations Council</a> for the communication of usage policies, primarily in association with the licensed distribution and use of news content by news gathering agencies, publishers, licensing organisations, business intermediaries and business consumers in the online news market-place. The RightsML ODRL Profile clearly documented:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>which features of the ODRL Information Model were supported,</li>
    <li>the supported policy types,</li>
    <li>the exact list of Actions to be supported for Permissions,</li>  
    <li>more refined definitions of some ODRL vocabulary terms, and</li>
    <li>additional Actions and Constraints (specific to the News industry).</li>
</ul>
    
    <p>The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) developed a comprehensive ODRL Profile for the mobile community. Although it was based on the ODRL Version 1.1 specification [[odrl]], the documentation included detailed specifications on the ODRL vocabulary to be supported, new and refined terms, a protocol to exchange ODRL Expressions (over mobile phones), and the relevant encoding schemas. The documentation is available here [[oma-profile]].</p>
