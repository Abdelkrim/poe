    <p>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for describing statements about digital content usage. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL statements. </p>
        <p>Policies are used to explicitly state what are the permitted and prohibited actions over a certain resource. In addition, policies may be integrated with complex constraints (e.g., time constraints) which apply to such actions to impose further restrictions to the uses of the resource. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>   

<p>Several business scenarios require to express what are the permitted and prohibited actions over digital content. These permitted/prohibited actions are usually expressed under the form of policies, i.e., entities that allow to indicate those uses and re-uses of the digital content which are comform with the existing regulations or to the constraints assigned by the owner. Policies may also be enriched with additional information, i.e., who are the entities in charge of the definition of such Policy and those who are required to conform to it, what are the additional constrains to be associated with the Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties expressed by the Policy. The ability to express these concepts and relationships is important both for the producers of digital content, i.e., they may state in a clear way what are the permitted and the prohibited actions to prevent misuses, and for the consumers, i.e., they may know precisely how they are allowed to use and re-use the digital content to avoid breaking the law or the owner's constraints. This specification describes a common approach to expressing these concepts, and more.</p>
<p>The ODRL Information Model defines the underlying semantic model for permission and obligation statements describing digital content usage. The information model covers the core concepts, entities and relationships that provide the foundational model for content usage statements. These machine-readable policies may be linked directly with the digital content they are associated to with the aim to allow consumers to easily retrieve those information.</p>
     
<section id="aimsModel">
<h3>Aims of the Model</h3>

<p>The primary aim of the ODRL Information Model is to provide a standard description model and format to express permission and obligation statements to be associated to digital content in general. These permission and obligation statements are employed to describe the terms of use and reuse of digital resources. The model should cover as many Permission and Obligation use cases as possible, while keeping the policy modeling easy even when dealing with complex uses.</p>

<p>The ODRL Information Model is a single, consistent model that can be used by all interested parties. All efforts have been made to keep the implementation costs for both digital content producers and consumers to a minimum. A single method of fulfilling a use case is strongly preferred over multiple methods, unless there are existing standards that need to be accommodated or there is a significant cost associated with using only a single method. While the Information Model is built using Linked Data principles, the design is intended to allow non-graph-based implementations also. </p>

<h2>Relationship to the W3C ODRL Community Group Reports</h2>

    
<p>The basis for the deliverables for the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group are the reports created by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a>. The ODRL Community Group has developed a family of specifications to support innovative expression of digital asset usage for the publication, distribution and consumption of content services.
The final outputs of the ODRL Community Group were the ODRL Version 2.1 specifications that were a major update for ODRL and superseded the original ODRL Version 1.1 [[odrl]] (published as a W3C NOTE).</p>
    
<p>The following documents are part of the ODRL Community Group report series:</p>
<ul>
<li>ODRL V2 Requirements [[odrl2-req]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Core Model [[odrl21-model]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Common Vocabulary [[odrl21-vocab]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 XML Encoding [[odrl21-xml]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Ontology [[odrl21-onto]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 JSON Encoding [[odrl21-json]]</li>
</ul>

 <p>
The ODRL Information Model was derived from the ODRL V2.1 Core Model Community Group report. Details of the differences between the W3C Working Group deliverables and the ODRL Community Group Reports are maintained in the <a href="#community">Appendix</a>. All new ODRL implementations are expected to use the deliverables of the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group. </p>

<h2>ODRL Information Model</h2>


<p>The basic context of an ODRL Policy is that only an explicitly permitted use may be executed. Any use not explicitly permitted is prohibited by default. An ODRL Policy only permits the action explicitly specified in a Permission and all other actions are implicitly prohibited. An action defined in a Prohibition SHOULD only refine (or directly relate to) the semantics of an action defined in one of the Permissions in the ODRL Policy.</p>
    
<p>For example, an ODRL Policy that has the action &#8220;present&#8221; Permission and may also have the action &#8220;print&#8221; Prohibition (as these actions are related hierarchically in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]]).</p>
<p>Note that ODRL Profiles can be developed and used to refine the basic context of an ODRL Policy. Hence, the application of an ODRL Profile must be understood by the consuming community and systems.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the ODRL Information Model. The <code>Policy</code> is the central entity that holds an ODRL policy together. </p>

<figure>
	<img src="fig/00Model.png" alt="ODRL Information Model" width="800"/>
    <figcaption>ODRL Information Model</figcaption>
</figure>

  
    
<p>As the Information Model diagram shows the key <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code> and <code>Duty</code> entities are subtypes of the abstract <code><em>Rule</em></code> class. These Rules have the same relationships to the other key entities (<code>Action</code>, <code>Constraint</code>, <code>Asset</code>, and <code>Party</code>). The core difference is in their semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Permission</code> says that the <code>Party</code> MAY perform an action,</li>
<li><code>Duty</code> says that the <code>Party</code> MUST perform an action, and</li>
<li><code>Prohibition</code> says that the <code>Party</code> MUST NOT perform an action.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code><em>Rule</em></code> class also makes it possible to easily extend the Information Model in Profiles by adding policy expressions (as subclasses of <code><em>Rule</em></code>) that are not possible by default.</p>
    
<p>The cardinalities shown in the ODRL Information Model allow for the greatest flexibility in expressing associations between the key entities. However, Policy types and ODRL Profiles may express narrower and/or specific cardinalities on these entities.</p>

<p>A <code>Permission</code> MAY allow a particular <code>Action</code> to be executed on a related <code>Asset</code>, e.g., &#8220;play the audio file abc.mp3&#8221;. A <code>Constraint</code> such as &#8220;at most 10 times&#8221; might be added to specify the <code>Permission</code> more precisely. The <code>Party</code> that grants this <code>Permission</code> is linked to it with the <code>Role</code> <code>assigner</code>, the <code>Party</code> that is granted the <code>Permission</code> is linked to it with the <code>Role</code> <code>assignee</code>, e.g., &#8220;assigner VirtualMusicShop grants the Permission to assignee Alice&#8221;. Additionally, a <code>Permission</code> MAY be linked to <code>Duty</code> entities.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>Permission</code>s, a <code>Duty</code> states that a certain <code>Action</code> MUST be executed by the <code>Party</code> with the <code>Role</code> <code>assignee</code> for the <code>Permission</code> to be valid, e.g. &#8220;Alice must pay 5 Euros in order to get the Permission to play abc.mp3&#8243;.</p>
    
<p>The <code>Prohibition</code> entity is used in the same way as <code>Permission</code>, with the difference that it MUST NOT refer to <code>Duties</code> and that the <code>Action</code> MUST NOT be exercised, e.g. &#8220;Alice is forbidden to use abc.mp3 commercially&#8221;.</p>
    
<p>The following sections describes each entity of the Information Model in greater detail.</p>

<section id="policy">
<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>The Policy entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the Policy entity (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>type</code>: indicates the semantics of the Policy entity (REQUIRED). These are further described in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] and ODRL Profiles.</li>
<li><code>conflict</code>: indicates how to handle Policy conflicts (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>undefined</code>: indicates how to handle undefined Actions (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>inheritAllowed</code>: indicates if the Policy entity can be inherited (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>profile</code>: the identifier of the ODRL Profile that this Policy conforms to (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>uid</code> attribute MUST be a unique identifier.</p>
    
<p>The range of values for the Policy entity&#8217;s <code>type</code> attribute will be described in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or in ODRL Profiles. This value MAY also impose further constraints on the Information Model. It is important that the <code>type</code> attribute be clearly understood in policy expressions as the semantics MAY impose restrictions on the expression language constructs such as cardinalities between entities. For example, the ODRL Agreement Policy Type stipluates that it must contain two Parties (an Assigner and Assignee).</p>
    
 

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: A Policy of type Set states that the Asset http//example.com/asset:9898 is the target of the Permission read and the Prohibition reproduce. No Parties or other elements are involved.</p>

<section id="structure">
<h4>Policy Structures</h4>
             
    <p>The ODRL Information Model supports flexibility in the information structures to declare ODRL expressions. A Policy MAY contain multiple Rules, and each Rule MAY contain multiple Assets, Parties, Actions, Constraints, and Duties. A Policy MAY also contain Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level, and these apply to all of the enclosing Rules in the Policy.</p>
     
     <p>At the core <i>atomic</i> level, an ODRL Rule (Permission and/or Prohibition) would typically contain one Asset, one or more Parties, one Action, and potentially one Constraint and/or Duty, as shown in the example below:</p>
             
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
    }
    "type": "odrl:Agreement",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
    }]
}  
</pre>

<p>As multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions are support for each Rule, then the following (snippet) example with two Assets:</p>
    
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "target": "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
</pre>

<p>Would then be mapped to two <i>atomic</i> Rules:</p>
    
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
</pre>
    
    <p>The processing model for Permission/Prohibition Rules with multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions to generate <i>atomic</i> Rules includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>If there are multiple Assets (with the same Relation), then create new Rules (one for each Asset) and include one Asset relation, and all the other (non-Asset) entities.</li>
    <li>If there are multiple Parties (with the same Role), then create new Rules (one for each Party) and include one Party Role, and all the other (non-Party Role) entities.</li>
    <li>If there are multiple Actions, then create new Rules (one for each Action) and include one Action, and all the other (non-Action) entities.</li>
    </ol>
       
    <p>An ODRL Policy MAY also declare multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level. This indicates that these are all common to all the enclosing Rules, as shown in the below example:</p>
             
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
    }
    "type": "odrl:Agreement",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
    "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
    "action": "odrl:play",
    "permission": [{
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy"
        }]
    }]
}  
</pre>

<p>To fully expand the Rules, the Policy-level Assets, Parties, and Actions MUST be added to all the Rules in the Policy. As shown below, the policy-level Target, Assigner, and Action are added to the two permission Rules:</p>
    
<pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
    }

    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy"
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        }]
    }]
}  
</pre>  
    
       <p>The processing model for Policies with multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Assets in the enclosing Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
   <li>Replicate all Policy-level Parties in the enclosing Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Actions in the enclosing Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
      <li>Follow the processing model (defined above) to create <i>atomic</i> Rules.</li>  
    </ol>
       
    
    
    </section>
             
     <section id="provenace">
<h4>Policy Provenance</h4>
         
       <p>Provenance attributes MAY be added to the Policy entity to support additional authenticity, integrity, and interpretation. Typically, these will be from external community vocabularies. </p>
         
         <p>The following Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[!DCTERMS]] SHOULD be used:</p>
            <ul>
         <li>dc:creator - the individual, agent, or organisation that authored the Policy.</li>
         <li>dc:issued - the date (and time) the Policy was first issued.</li>
         <li>dc:modified -  the date (and time) the Policy was updated.</li>
        <li>dc:coverage -  the jurisdiction under which the Policy is relevant.</li>
        <li>dc:replaces -  the identifier (uid) of a Policy that this Policy supersedes.</li>

    <section id="conflict">
<h4>Policy Conflict</h4>
        
<p>The <code>conflict</code> attribute is used to establish strategies to resolve conflicts that arise from the merging of Policies or conflicts between Permissions and Prohibitions in the same Policy. Conflicts may arise when merging Policies about the same Asset and the resultant Actions are inconsistent. For example, one Policy stated that Assignee Fred had been granted an "exclusive" distribution Permission, and the other Policy said the same for Assignee Mary. In the same Policy, conflicts can also arise when the same Action is used in a Permission and a Prohibition. </p>
    
    <p>The <code>conflict</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perm</code>: the <code>Permission</code>s MUST override the Prohibitions</li>
<li><code>prohibit</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code>s MUST override the Permissions</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the entire Policy MUST be invalid if any conflict is detected</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>conflict</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>invalid</code> will be used.</p>

<p>In cases where both <code>perm</code> and <code>prohibit</code> are used in Policies, and that causes contradictory outcomes (ie the conflict cannot be resolved), then the outcome MUST be an <code>invalid</code> Policy.</p>
	
<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: Two Policies are associated to the same target Asset http://example.com/asset:1212. The first Policy http://example.com/policy:0001 allows to use the Asset. The second Policy http://example.com/policy:0002 allows for the display of the Asset, but it prohibits print. Both policies explicitly state how to deal with conflicts through the <code>conflict</code> attribute being set to <code>perm</code>. Hence the Permissions will always override any Prohibitions. In this use case, since the print Action is a subset of the use Action, there could be a conflict. However, the <code>perm</code> conflict strategy means that the use Permission will override the print Prohibition.</p>

    <section id="undefined">
<h4>Undefined Actions</h4>
    
<p>The <code>undefined</code> attribute is used to indicate how to process unsupported Actions. That is, if an ODRL expression contains an Action that is not from a known (or supported) ODRL vocabulary, how should the Action be treated in the context of the whole ODRL Policy?</p>
        
 <p>The <code>undefined</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>support</code>: the undefined Action is to be <b>supported</b> as part of the Policy &#8211; and the Policy remains valid</li>
<li><code>ignore</code>: the undefined Action is to be <b>ignored</b> and is not part of the Policy &#8211; and the Policy remains valid</li>
    <li><code>invalid</code>: the undefined Action is unknown &#8211; and the entire Policy is <b>invalid</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, systems that process ODRL expressions SHOULD provide mechanisms that adequately address these three outcomes. That is, how the Action can be <b>supported</b>, or <b>ignored</b>, or the entire Policy is <b>invalid</b>. </p>


        <p>If the <code>undefined</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>invalid</code> SHALL be used.</p>

  <p><b>Example Use Case</b>: A Policy of type Set states that the Asset can be <i>recorded</i>. The processing system does not understand this Action, and since the <b>undefined</b> attribute is <b>invalid</b>, then the entire Policy is deemed invalid.</p>

<section id="inhertiance">
<h4>Policy Inheritance</h4>

    <p>ODRL supports a simple inheritance mechanism in which a (child) Policy may inherit all the information structures of another (parent) Policy. The inheritance is aimed at <i>including</i> data structures between Policies.</p>
    
<p>The <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute in the Policy entity is used to indicate if the Policy expression can be used in any inheritance relationship. If present, the value of the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code>: the Policy expression can be used for inheritance</li>
<li><code>false</code>: the Policy expression can not be used for inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>true</code> will be used.</p>
<p>The following attributes SHOULD be used in a child Policy that is inheriting from a parent Policy in which that parent Policy MUST allow inheritance (via the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute) :</p>

    <ul>
    <li><code>inheritFrom</code>: the identifier of the parent Policy from which this child Policy inherits from</li>
<li><code>inheritRelation</code>: the identifier of the relationship context of this inheritance structure</li>
    </ul>
    
    
<p>The <code>inheritFrom</code> association in the (child) Policy will uniquely identify (via a UID) the (parent) Policy from which the inheritance will be performed.</p>
<p>The <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute in the (child) Policy will uniquely identify (via a UID) the context of inheritance from the (parent) Policy. For example, this may indicate the business scenario, such as <em>subscription</em>, or prior arrangements between the Parties (that are not machine representable). Such terms SHOULD be defined in the ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or ODRL Profiles. For example, an Assigner and Assignee may have a historical arrangement related to the specific use of content they make available to each other. The business model (identified with a URI) is used in the <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute in their subsequent ODRL Policies they exchange. This will require the ODRL Policy to be interpreted with the additional information identified by the URI. For example, this may include additional permission Actions or constraints (etc) that is documented in their business model arrangement.</p>
<p>Both the <code>inheritFrom</code> association and <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute may be used independently.</p>
    
<p>The following restrictions apply when using inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single inheritance is only supported. (One parent Policy to one or more child Policy entities. No child Policy can inherit from two or more parent Policy entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance can be to any depth. (Multiple levels of children Policy entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance MUST NOT be circular.</li>
<li>No state information is transferred from the parent Policy to the child Policy.</li>
</ul>
	
<p><b>Example Use Case:</b>Consider the below (parent) Policy that has been expressed primarly for inheritance purposes:</p>    
    
    <pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {

    "permission": [{
        "action": "odrl:use"
    }]
}  
</pre>
    
<p>The below (child) Policy includes the inheritFrom attribute pointing to the above (parent) Policy. The (child) Policy also includes its own specific policy-level asset, and two Permission Rules.</p>    
    
    <pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">

        "action": "odrl:print"
    }]
}  
</pre>
    

<p>After the inheritance is performed - where the (parent) Policy information structures are added to the (child) Policy - the resultant Policy is shown below:</p>    
    
    <pre class="example highlight hljs xquery">
{

    "permission": [{
        "action": "odrl:use"
    }]
}  
</pre>
    
   
    
<p>The processing model for ODRL Policy Inheritance includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>A (child) Policy with an <code>inheritFrom</code> attribute MUST first verify that the (parent) Policy does not contain the <code>inhertiAllowed</code> attribute with the value "false".</li>
   <li>The (child) Policy MUST access the (parent) Policy and replicate the following in the (child) Policy:
       <ul>
           <li>All policy-level Assets, Parties, Actions.</li>
           <li>All Permission and Prohibition Rules.</li>
       </ul>
      <li>The (child) Policy can then be further expanded (into <i>atomic</i> Rules) by following the processing models defined in the <a href="#structure">Policy Structure</a> section.</li>  
    </ol>

<section id="asset">
<h3>Asset</h3>
<p>The Asset entity is the subject of an ODRL policy expression that Permissions and Prohibitions are applied to. The Asset entity can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, or services. Furthermore, it can be used to represent other <code>Asset</code> entities that are needed to undertake the Policy expression, such as with the Duty entity. The Asset entity is referred to by the Permission and/or Prohibition entities, and also by the Duty entity.</p>
<p>The Asset entity contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the Asset (REQUIRED)</li>
    <li><code>scope</code>: defines how the Asset shall be interpreted under different contexts. (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The identification of the Asset entity is a key foundation of the ODRL Policy language. In general, the <code>uid</code> SHOULD be a URI [[rfc3986]] representing the identifier for the Asset. There MAY also be other alternative identifers, or identification mechanisms that could be used. For example, to identify specific parts of an Asset, Media Fragments URI [[media-frags]] may be utilised. To identify groups or a range of Assets, then POWDER [[powder-primer]], URI Templates [[rfc6570]], or URI wildcards may be utilised. <p>
    
    <p>There are some use cases where the ODRL Policy expression MAY be embedded inside the target Asset. In these cases, it MAY be more appropriate to provide, or infer, a link to the Asset entity (as the complete Asset <code>uid</code> may not be known at the time) through the local context. Use of such inference and context MUST be documented in the relevant ODRL Profile.</p>
<p>Since ODRL Policies could deal with any kind of asset, the ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata to describe Asset entities of particular media types. It is recommended to use already existing metadata standards, such as <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/" rel="external nofollow">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> that are appropriate to the Asset type or purpose.</p>


<section id="relation">
<h4>Relation</h4>

<p>The Relation entity is an association class and can be used to link to an Asset from either Permission, Duty or Prohibition, indicating how the Asset SHOULD be utilised in respect to the entity that links to it.</p>
<p>The Relation entity contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>relation</code>: indicates the relationship of the Asset to the linked entity (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value for the <code>relation</code> attribute is <code>target</code> which indicates that the Asset is the primary object to which the Permission, Duty or Prohibition actions apply.</p>
    
<p>Other values for the Relation entity SHOULD be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>

<h4>Scope</h4>
    
    <p>The <code>scope</code> attribute SHOULD be used to indicate the context under which to interpret the Asset entity.

<h3>Party</h3>
    
<p>The Party entity is the object of an ODRL Policy and can be any form of identifiable entity, such as a person, group of people, organisation, or agent. An agent is a person or thing that takes an active Role or produces a specified effect. The Party performs (or does not perform) Actions or has a function in a Duty (i.e., assigns the Party to the Rule by associating it with the Role it plays in the Rule).</p>
    
<p>The Party entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the Party (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>function</code>: defines the Roles fulfilled by a Party in relation to a Rule (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>scope</code>: defines how the Role shall be interpreted under different contexts. (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata for the Party element. It is recommended to use already existing metadata standards, such as the W3C vCard Ontology [[vcard-rdf]] or FOAF [[foaf]], that are appropriate to the Party type or purpose.</p>
<p>The Role entity is used to associate the Party entity with the relevant Permission, Prohibition, and Duty entities.</p>

<li><code>Party</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code> MAY refer to one or more <code>Party</code> entities linked via the <code>Role</code> entity (see Section 2.3.1) (OPTIONAL)</li>
    
    <li><code>Constraint</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code> MAY refer to one or more Constraints which affect the validity of the Prohibition - it only becomes effective if all of the referred Constraints are true (OPTIONAL). For example; the Action display is only prohibited for a certain country.</li>
    
</ul>

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The owner and assigner of a target Asset <code>http://example.com/photoAlbum:55</code> needs an Agreement Policy expressing with both a Permission and a Prohibition. Then assigner Party <code>http://example.com/MyPix:55</code> assigns the Permission display to the assignee Party <code>http://example.com/assignee:55</code> at the same time they are prohibited from archiving the target Asset. Additionally, in case of any conflict between permissions and prohibitions, the conflict attribute is set to <code>perm</code> indicating that the Permission entity will take precedence.</p>

<h3>Duty</h3>

<p>A <code>Permission</code> entity MAY include a <code>Duty</code> entity that indicates a requirement that MUST be satisfied in order to undertake the <code>Permission</code>. A <code>Duty</code> MUST only be associated with a <code>Permission</code>. </p>
    
    <p>The <code>Duty</code> entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: a unique identification for this <code>Duty</code>. Used to refer a single <code>Duty</code> to multiple <code>Permission</code> entities (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Duty</code> entity has the following relations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Action</code>: indicates the requirement that MUST be performed (REQUIRED). Note: It is assumed that the assigned Party has the appropriate permissions to perform this action.</li>
<li><code>Party</code>: a <code>Duty</code> MAY refer to <code>Party</code> entities with different <code>Role</code>s. If no explicit <code>Party</code> is linked to as <code>assignee</code> or <code>assigner</code>, the <code>Parties</code> with the respective <code>Role</code>s are taken from the referring <code>Permission</code>. (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>Asset</code>: a <code>Duty</code> entity MAY refer to an <code>Asset</code> (where at least one, and only one, <code>relation</code> value is <code>target</code>) related to satisfying the <code>Duty</code>. (OPTIONAL) For example, a <code>nextPolicy</code> <code>Action</code> must be linked to the identifier of a target policy <code>Asset</code>.</li>

    <li><code>Constraint</code>: a <code>Duty</code> MAY refer to one or more Constraints which affect the fulfillment of the Duty - it is only fulfilled if all of the referred Constraints are true (OPTIONAL). For example; the Duty Action payAmount is only fulfilled if a specific amount is paid.
</li>
       
</ul>
    
    <p>If a <code>Permission</code> refers to several <code>Duty</code> entities, <em>all of them</em> MUST be satisfied for the <code>Permission</code> to be undertaken. If several <code>Permission</code> entities refer to one <code>Duty</code>, then the Duty only has to be satisfied <em>once</em> for all the <code>Permission</code> entities.</p>
    
<p>Even though a <code>Duty</code> entity is mandatory, the ODRL model does not specify any conditions on <em>WHEN</em> the <code>Duty</code> <code>Action</code> MUST be performed. Such business rules MAY be expressed through additional <code>Constraint</code>s.  For example, a Policy may state that you can play a music file for a payment of $5.00. This does not indicate when the $5.00 should be paid, as different business rules may apply such as montly invoicing.</p>
    
<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The Party <code>http://example.com/assigner:sony</code> makes and <code>Offer</code> to <code>Play</code> the music file <code>http://example.com/music/1999.mp3</code>. There are two <code>Duties</code> that both must be satisfied for the <code>compensate</code> requirement. The first is the <code>payAmount</code> of $AUD5.00 and the second is the <code>event</code> of this <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/policyUsage</code> must not have occured yet.

The purpose value is taken from the P3P privacy purpose vocabulary. Additionally, the Party has stipulated that the assignee must delete the Asset after a 30 day period, i.e., retention policy.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>


<p>The <code>Action</code> entity (when related to a <code>Permission</code> entity) indicates the operations (e.g. <code>play</code>, <code>copy</code>, etc.) that the <code>assignee</code> (i.e. the consumer) is <em>permitted</em> to perform on the related <code>Asset</code> linked to by <code>Permission</code>. When related to a <code>Prohibition</code>, the <code>Action</code> entity indicates the operations that the <code>assignee</code> (again the consumer) is <em>prohibited</em> to perform on the <code>Asset</code> linked to by <code>Prohibition</code>. Analogously, when related to a <code>Duty</code>, it indicates the operation to be performed.</p>
<p><code>Action</code> contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: indicates the <code>Action</code> entity term (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>As its value, the <code>name</code> attribute SHOULD take one of a set of <code>Action</code> <em>names</em> which are formally defined in Profiles. The ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] defines a standard set of potential terms that MAY be used. Communities will develop new (or extend existing) profiles to capture additional and refined semantics.</p>

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The Party needs to define an Offer policy granting a permission about the target Asset <code>http://example.com/music:1012</code>, namely the permission to play the Asset.</p>

<section id="constraint">
<h3>Constraint</h3>
    
    <p>The <code>Constraint</code> entity indicates limits and restrictions to the Permission, the Prohibition and the Duty entity. Constraints express a rule for comparing two operands by one operator. If the two operands match the result of the constraint is <b>TRUE</b>.</p>
        <p>
       For example, the &#8220;number of usages&#8221; (<code>leftOperand</code>) must be &#8220;smaller than&#8221; (<code>operator</code>) the &#8220;number 10&#8221; (<code>rightOperand</code>).</p>
       
<p>If multiple <code>Constraint</code> entities are linked to the same <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, or <code>Duty</code> entity, then all of the <code>Constraint</code> entities MUST be satisfied. That is, all the <code>Constraint</code> entities are (boolean) <em>and</em>ed. In the case where the same <code>Constraint</code> is repeated, then these MUST be represented as a single <code>Constraint</code> entity using an appropriate <code>operator</code> value (for example, <code>isAnyOf</code>).</p>
       
<p>The <code>Constraint</code> entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>leftOperand</code>: a name that identifies the left operand of the operation (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>operator</code>: an operator function (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>rightOperand</code>: the right operand of the operation (REQUIRED if no rightOperandReference)</li>
<li><code>rightOperandReference</code>: the right operand of the operation (REQUIRED if no rightOperand)</li>
<li><code>dataType</code>: the datatype of the rightOperand (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>unit</code>: the units of the rightOperand (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>status</code>: the current value of the left operand (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
        
<p>
    
    The <code>leftOperand</code> identifies the left operand of the logic operation for the Constraint, it SHOULD include the entity it constrains and how its value for a comparison has to be retrieved/generated. It MAY include the datatype of the value and it MAY include references to resources for retrieving/generating the value.
        </p>
    
    <p>The <code>operator</code> identifies the comparative operation such as &#8220;greater than&#8221; or &#8220;equal to&#8221;. </p>
    <p>The actual value of the constraint that is to be compared to the <code>leftOperand</code> is either represented with the <code>rightOperand</code> or <code>rightOperandReference</code>. The <code>rightOperand</code> represents the literal value (such as "10" or "http://example.com/c100") and <code>rightOperandReference</code> represents a URI that MUST be dereferenced to obtain the actual value. Only one of these MUST appear in the constraint.  </p>
        
        <p>The <code>dataType</code> indicates the type of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as &#8220;decimal&#8221; or &#8220;datetime&#8221; and the <code>unit</code> indicates the unit value of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as &#8220;EU dollars&#8221;.</p>

        
<p>The <code>status</code> provides the current value of the <code>Constraint</code> variable (i.e. current value of <code>leftOperand</code>). This is useful in cases where the current status of <code>Constraint</code>s needs to be captured and expressed in the ODRL Information Model.</p>

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The Party <code>http://example.com/myPix:6161</code> wants to assign the Permission distribute directly to the potential buyer of the permission who will pay 100 EUR for this grant. The distribute Permission is also constrained to a specific country, i.e., Italy. The potential assignee may then distribute the target Asset <code>http://example.com/wallpaper:1234</code> according to the nextPolicy target Asset linked directly from this Duty. In this case, the next Policy Asset stipulates that the potential assignee may only offer the display Permission to downstream consumers.</p>

<h2>ODRL Profiles</h2>

    <section id="profile-motivation">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
        
<p>The ODRL Information Model serves as a framework to express Policies and the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] provides a broad range of common actions for Permissions, Prohibition, Duties as well as Policy Types, Constraint names, Asset relations, and Party roles. For communities that implement ODRL, the entire ODRL Information Framework and the entire Vocabulary would be too onerous when they will typically have very specific needs, as well as needs not covered by the ODRL vocabulary. </p>
<p>In these common cases, it is strongly recommended that a community create and formally document an ODRL Profile. An ODRL Profile will directly serve the communities needs by excluding features of the ODRL Information Model that they do not require (for example, inheritance) and specifying only the terms of the ODRL Vocabulary they wish to support. In addition, the ODRL Profile may include additional vocabulary terms specific to their community.</p>
        <p>The ODRL Profile may also include specific implementation details on how to determine the status and processing of Rules and Constraints. For example, the ODRL Profile may require the use of a thrid-party time-service to ensure temporal constraints are meet correctly (and will document the API details etc), or document the API to access values that need to be compared to the ODRL expression values (such as what location is the asset currently being used in).</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="profile-requirements">
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
      
<p>
    The <code>profile</code> attribute in the <code>Policy</code> entity is used to indicate the identifier (URI) of the ODRL Profile for which the policy expression conforms to. This attribute is OPTIONAL, but if the attribute appears, then any consuming system MUST understand the identified ODRL Profile and all the constraints in the ODRL Profile MUST apply to the policy expression. If a consuming system does not understand the ODRL Profile URI, then it MAY continue processing the policy expression, but it SHOULD NOT assume it has interpreted the policy expression correctly. </p>
    
    <p>If multiple ODRL Profiles are required, then it is recommended that a new identifier SHOULD be created to identify the combination of Profiles (and document the combined Profiles).</p>
<p>
The requirements for communities developing ODRL Profiles MUST document the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Any additions to the Information Model</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that will have different default values or (editorial) interpretations</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that is not being supported</li>
<li>New Vocabulary terms</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms not explicitly being suported</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms with more specific interpretations</li>
<li>The ODRL Profile identifier (URI)</li>
    </ul>
  
<p>The community SHOULD also create a machine-readable schema for their ODRL Profile following the appropriate serialisations options outlined in the ODRL Vocabulary and Expression specification [[!vocab-odrl]]. In this case, the ODRL Profile URI MUST also be used as the serialisation namespace URI.</p>

<p>It is also recommended to share the ODRL Profile with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a> for feedback and comments. In addition, the W3C ODRL Community Group may host the ODRL Profile documents on their website. </p>
    </section>
    
<section id="profile-example">
    <h3>Profile Examples</h3>
<p>
An example ODRL Profile - called RightsML [[rights-ml]] was developed by the <a href="https://www.iptc.org">International Press and Telecommuncations Council</a> for the communication of usage policies, primarily in association with the licensed distribution and use of news content by news gathering agencies, publishers, licensing organisations, business intermediaries and business consumers in the online news market-place. The RightsML ODRL Profile clearly documented:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>which features of the ODRL Information Model were supported,</li>
    <li>the supported policy types,</li>
    <li>the exact list of actions to be supported for Permissions,</li>  
    <li>more refined definitions of some ODRL vocabulary terms, and</li>
    <li>additional actions and constraints (specific to the News industry).</li>
</ul>
    
    <p>The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) developed a comprehensive ODRL Profile for the mobile community. Although it was based on the ODRL Version 1.1 specification [[odrl]], the documentation included detailed specifications on the ODRL vocabulary to be supported, new and refined terms, a protocol to exchange ODRL Expressions (over mobile phones), and the relevant encoding schemas. The documentation is available here [[oma-profile]].</p>
