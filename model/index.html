    <p>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for describing statements about content usage. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL statements. </p>
        <p>Policies are used to explicitly state what are the permitted and prohibited actions over a certain resource. In addition, policies may be integrated with complex constraints (e.g., time constraints) which apply to such actions to impose further restrictions to the uses of the resource. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>   

<p>Several business scenarios require to express what are the permitted and prohibited actions over  content. These permitted/prohibited actions are usually expressed under the form of policies, i.e., entities that allow to indicate those uses and re-uses of the content which are comform with the existing regulations or to the constraints assigned by the owner. Policies may also be enriched with additional information, i.e., who are the entities in charge of the definition of such Policy and those who are required to conform to it, what are the additional constrains to be associated with the Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties expressed by the Policy. The ability to express these concepts and relationships is important both for the producers of content, i.e., they may state in a clear way what are the permitted and the prohibited actions to prevent misuses, and for the consumers, i.e., they may know precisely how they are allowed to use and re-use the content to avoid breaking the law or the owner's constraints. This specification describes a common approach to expressing these concepts, and more.</p>
<p>The ODRL Information Model defines the underlying semantic model for permission and obligation statements describing content usage. The information model covers the core concepts, entities and relationships that provide the foundational model for content usage statements. These machine-readable policies may be linked directly with the content they are associated to with the aim to allow consumers to easily retrieve those information.</p>
     
<section id="aimsModel">
<h3>Aims of the Model</h3>

<p>The primary aim of the ODRL Information Model is to provide a standard description model and format to express permission and obligation statements to be associated to content in general. These permission and obligation statements are employed to describe the terms of use and reuse of  resources. The model should cover as many Permission and Obligation use cases as possible, while keeping the policy modeling easy even when dealing with complex uses.</p>

<p>The ODRL Information Model is a single, consistent model that can be used by all interested parties. All efforts have been made to keep the implementation costs for both content producers and consumers to a minimum. A single method of fulfilling a use case is strongly preferred over multiple methods, unless there are existing standards that need to be accommodated or there is a significant cost associated with using only a single method. While the Information Model is built using Linked Data principles, the design is intended to allow non-graph-based implementations also. </p>

<h2>Relationship to the W3C ODRL Community Group Reports</h2>

    
<p>The basis for the deliverables for the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group are the reports created by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a>. The ODRL Community Group has developed a family of specifications to support innovative expression of  asset usage for the publication, distribution and consumption of content services.
The final outputs of the ODRL Community Group were the ODRL Version 2.1 specifications that were a major update for ODRL and superseded the original ODRL Version 1.1 [[odrl]] (published as a W3C NOTE).</p>
    
<p>The following documents are part of the ODRL Community Group report series:</p>
<ul>
<li>ODRL V2 Requirements [[odrl2-req]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Core Model [[odrl21-model]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Common Vocabulary [[odrl21-vocab]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 XML Encoding [[odrl21-xml]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Ontology [[odrl21-onto]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 JSON Encoding [[odrl21-json]]</li>
</ul>

 <p>
The ODRL Information Model was derived from the ODRL V2.1 Core Model Community Group report. Details of the differences between the W3C Working Group deliverables and the ODRL Community Group Reports are maintained in the <a href="#community">Appendix</a>. All new ODRL implementations are expected to use the deliverables of the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group. </p>

<h2>ODRL Information Model</h2>

    <p>The ODRL Information Model enables Policies to express Permissions and Prohibitions related to the usage of Assets. In essence, this explicitly expresses what is allowed and what is not allowed by the Policy, as well as other requirements and parties involved. The aim of the ODRL Information Model is to support flexible Policy expressions by allowing the author to include as much, or as little, expressive detail.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the ODRL Information Model. The Policy is the central entity that holds an ODRL policy together. </p>

<figure>
	<img src="fig/00Model.svg" alt="ODRL Information Model" width="800"/>
    <figcaption>ODRL Information Model</figcaption>
</figure>

  
    
<p>The ODRL Information Model diagram shows the Permission, Prohibition, and Duty classes as subclasses of the abstract Rule concept. These Rules have common relationships to the other key concepts (specifically, Action, Asset, Party, and Constraint). However, there are core differences in their semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Permission indicates that the Policy expresses an Action that MAY be performed,</li>
<li>A Prohibition indicates that the Policy expresses an Action that MUST NOT be performed, and</li>
<li>A Duty indicates that the Policy expresses an agreed Action that MUST be performed (as a requirement to be granted a Permission). </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>As an example, a Permission in a Policy MAY allow a particular Action to be applied to an Asset, e.g., &#8220;play the audio file abc.mp3&#8221;. A Constraint, such as &#8220;at most 10 times&#8221;, MAY be added to express limitations to the Actions. The Party "VirtualMusicShop" that granted this Permission MAY be included with the Role Assigner, and the Party "Alice" that is granted the Permission MAY be included with the Role Assignee.</p>
</blockquote>
    
<p>Similar to Permissions, a Duty states that a certain agreed Action MUST be executed by the Party with the Role Assignee for the Permission to be valid, e.g. &#8220;Alice must pay 5 Euros in order to get the Permission to play abc.mp3&#8243;.</p>

    
<section id="policy">
<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>The Policy entity has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Policy entity MUST refer to the <code>uid</code> identification of the Policy entity.</li>
<li>The Policy entity MUST refer to the <code>type</code> indicating the specific type of Policy entity.</li>
<li>The Policy entity MAY refer to the <code>conflict</code> attribute indicating how to handle Policy conflicts.</li>
<li>The Policy entity MAY refer to the <code>undefined</code> attribute indicating how to handle undefined Actions.</li>
<li>The Policy entity MAY refer to the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute indicating the Policy entity can be inherited by other Policies.</li>
<li>The Policy entity MAY refer to the ODRL <code>profile</code> identifier that this Policy conforms to.</li>
</ul>

<p>The values for the Policy entity&#8217;s <code>type</code> attribute are described in the ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or in ODRL Profiles. The Policy <code>type</code> describes the context of use of the Policy and MAY include additional constraints that processing systems MUST understand.</p>
<blockquote>    
    <p> For example, the "Agreement" Policy type stipulates minimal cardinalities for some for the Information Model entities, which are different than the "Offer" Policy type. In addition, and more importantly, the "Agreement" Policy type expresses that the Permissions/Prohibitions have been granted, but the "Offer" Policy type does not. </p>
    </blockquote>
<p>To illustrate the concepts described in the Information Model, we will start from basic examples to come to more sophisticated ones when concepts are discussed in more details. </p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below "Set" Policy type grants the Permission to read and the Prohibition to reproduce the target Asset http//example.com/asset:9898. No Parties or other elements are involved.</p>

<section id="composition">
<h4>Policy Composition</h4>
             
    <p>The ODRL Information Model supports flexibility in the composition of the information entities used to declare ODRL expressions. A Policy MAY contain multiple Rules, and each Rule MAY contain multiple Assets, Parties, Actions, Constraints, and Duties. A Policy MAY also contain Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level, and these entities apply to all of the enclosing Rules in the Policy.</p>
     
    <p>At the basic level, an ODRL Rule would refer to one Asset, one or more Parties, one Action, and potentially one Constraint and/or Duty, as shown in the example below. This example shows the <em>atomic</em> level of a Policy where it is <em>irreducible</em> and <em>unambiguous</em>.</p>
             
<pre class="example hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
    },
    "@type": "odrl:Agreement",
    "@id": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
    }]
}  
</pre>

<p>As multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions can be expressed for each Rule, then the following (snippet) example shows two Assets defined for the policy:</p>
    
<pre class="example hljs xquery">
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "target": "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
</pre>

<p>The above example could then be reduced to two <em>atomic</em> Rules, with the two target assets appearing individually in each:</p>
    
<pre class="example hljs xquery">
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
        }]
</pre>
    
    <p>In order to create the <em>atomic</em> Rules in a Policy, the processing model for policies with multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Where there are multiple Assets (with the same Relation), then create new Rules (one for each of these Assets) and include one Asset relation, and include all other (non-Asset) entities.</li>
    <li>Where there are multiple Parties (with the same Role), then create new Rules (one for each of these Parties) and include one Party Role, and ainclude all other (non-Party Role) entities.</li>
    <li>Where there are multiple Actions, then create new Rules (one for each of these Actions) and include one Action, and include all other (non-Action) entities.</li>
    </ol>
       
    <p>An ODRL Policy MAY also declare multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level (not just within a Rule). This implies that these entities are all common to all the Rules in the Policy, as shown in the below example:</p>
             
<pre class="example hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
    },
    "@type": "odrl:Agreement",
    "@id": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
    "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
    "action": "odrl:play",
    "permission": [{
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy"
        }]
    }]
}  
</pre>

<p>To fully expand the Rules, the Policy-level Assets, Parties, and Actions MUST be added to all the Rules in the Policy. As shown below, the policy-level Target, Assigner, and Action are added to the two permission Rules:</p>
    
<pre class="example hljs xquery">
{
    "@context": {
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
    },
    "@type": "odrl:Agreement",
    "@id": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy"
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "odrl:play",
        }]
    }]
}  
</pre>  
  
       <p>The processing model for Policies with multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions declared at the Policy-level includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Assets in each and all Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
   <li>Replicate all Policy-level Parties in each and all Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Actions in each and all Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
      <li>Follow the processing model (defined above) to create <em>atomic</em> Rules in the Policy.</li>  
    </ol>
       
    
    
    </section>
             
     <section id="provenace">
<h4>Policy Provenance</h4>
         
       <p>Provenance attributes MAY be added to the Policy entity to support additional authenticity, and integrity purposes from external vocabularies. The ODRL Information Model recommends the use of Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[!dcterms]] for ODRL Policies.</p>
         
         <p>The following Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[!dcterms]] SHOULD be used:</p>
            <ul>
         <li>dc:creator - the individual, agent, or organisation that authored the Policy.</li>      <li>dc:description - a human-readable representation or summary of the Policy.</li>
         <li>dc:issued - the date (and time) the Policy was first issued.</li>
         <li>dc:modified -  the date (and time) the Policy was updated.</li>
        <li>dc:coverage -  the jurisdiction under which the Policy is relevant.</li>
        <li>dc:replaces -  the identifier (uid) of a Policy that this Policy supersedes.</li>
        <li>dc:isReplacedBy -  the identifier (uid) of a Policy that supersedes this Policy.</li>
         </ul>
         
    <p>The processing model for Policies with the above provenance properties include:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>If a Policy contains the <strong>dc:isReplacedBy</strong> property, then the identified Policy MUST be retrieved and processed.</li>
    </ol>

    <section id="conflict">
<h4>Policy Conflict Strategy</h4>
        
<p>The <code>conflict</code> attribute is used to establish strategies to resolve conflicts that arise from the merging of Policies or conflicts between Permissions and Prohibitions in the same Policy. Conflicts may arise when merging Policies about the same Asset and the resultant Actions are inconsistent.</p>
      
    <p>The <code>conflict</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perm</code>: the Permissions MUST override the Prohibitions</li>
<li><code>prohibit</code>: the Prohibitions MUST override the Permissions</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the entire Policy MUST be invalid if any conflict is detected</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>conflict</code> attribute is not explicitly set, the default value of <code>invalid</code> will be used.</p>

        
<p>If an ODRL processor does not detect any conflicts in the Rules, then the ODRL Policy is valid, otherwise the ODRL processor MUST follow these processing rules:</p>
   
        <ol>
           <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> attribute of <code>perm</code> then any conflicting Permission Rule MUST override the Prohibition Rule and continue with the Policy as valid.</li>
 <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> attribute of <code>prohibit</code> then any conflicting Prohibition Rule MUST override the Permission Rule and continue with the Policy as valid.</li>
  <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> attribute of <code>invalid</code> then  processing MUST not continue and the entire Policy MUST be invalid.</li> 
 <li>If a Policy has multiple <code>conflict</code> attribute values (for example, after a Policy merge or inheritance) then processing MUST not continue and the entire Policy MUST be invalid.</li> 
        </ol>
       
        
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: Two Policies are associated to the same target Asset http://example.com/asset:1212. The first Policy http://example.com/policy:0001 allows to use the Asset. The second Policy http://example.com/policy:0002 allows for the display of the Asset, but it prohibits print. Both policies explicitly state how to deal with conflicts through the <code>conflict</code> attribute being set to <code>perm</code>. Hence the Permissions will always override any Prohibitions. In this use case, since the print Action is a subset of the use Action, there could be a conflict. However, the <code>perm</code> conflict strategy means that the use Permission will override the print Prohibition.</p>

<h4>Undefined Actions</h4>
    
        
<div class="issue" data-number="105">
    <p>The detection of undefined actions is viewed to be implementation-specific, and too vague to be part of the Information Model. This feature maybe removed in future versions.</p>
</div>
             
<p>The <code>undefined</code> attribute is used to indicate how to process unsupported Actions. That is, if an ODRL expression contains an Action that is not from a known (or supported) ODRL vocabulary, how should the Action be treated in the context of the whole ODRL Policy?</p>
        
 <p>The <code>undefined</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>support</code>: the undefined Action is to be <strong>supported</strong> as part of the Policy &#8211; and the Policy remains valid</li>
<li><code>ignore</code>: the undefined Action is to be <strong>ignored</strong> and is not part of the Policy &#8211; and the Policy remains valid</li>
    <li><code>invalid</code>: the undefined Action is unknown &#8211; and the entire Policy is <strong>invalid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, systems that process ODRL expressions SHOULD provide mechanisms that adequately address these three outcomes. That is, how the Action can be <strong>supported</strong>, or <strong>ignored</strong>, or the entire Policy is <strong>invalid</strong>. </p>


        <p>If the <code>undefined</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>invalid</code> SHALL be used.</p>
        
                
<p>The processing model for undefined actions includes:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>If a Policy has the <code>undefined</code> attribute of <code>support</code> and there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the processing system MUST support these actions as part of the valid Policy.</li>
    <li>If a Policy has the <code>undefined</code> attribute of <code>ignore</code> and there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the processing system MUST disregard these actions as part of the valid Policy.</li>
    <li>If a Policy has the <code>undefined</code> attribute of <code>invalid</code> and there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the processing system MUST process the entire Policy as invalid.</li>
     <li>If a Policy has multiple <code>undefined</code> attribute values (for example, after a Policy merge) AND there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the entire Policy MUST be processed as invalid.</li> 
    </ol>
      
        
<blockquote>
  <p>Example Use Case: A Policy of type Set states that the Asset can be <em>recorded</em>. The processing system does not understand this Action, and since the <strong>undefined</strong> attribute is <strong>invalid</strong>, then the entire Policy is deemed invalid.</p>

<h4>Policy Inheritance</h4>

    <p>ODRL supports a simple inheritance mechanism in which a (child) Policy may inherit all the information entities that the (parent) Policy is composed of. ODRL inheritance is aimed at <em>including</em> information entities from parent to child Policies.</p>
    
<p>The <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute in the Policy entity is used to indicate if the Policy expression can be used in any inheritance relationship. If present, the value of the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code>: the Policy expression can be used for inheritance</li>
<li><code>false</code>: the Policy expression can not be used for inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>true</code> will be used.</p>
<p>The following attribute SHOULD be used in a child Policy that is inheriting from a parent Policy in which that parent Policy MUST allow inheritance (via the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute) :</p>

    <ul>
    <li><code>inheritFrom</code>: the identifier of the parent Policy from which this child Policy inherits from</li>
    </ul>
    
    
<p>The <code>inheritFrom</code> association in the (child) Policy will uniquely identify (via a UID) the (parent) Policy from which the inheritance will be performed.</p>

<p>The following restrictions apply when using inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single inheritance is only supported. (One parent Policy to one or more child Policy entities. No child Policy can inherit from two or more parent Policy entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance can be to any depth. (Multiple levels of children Policy entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance MUST NOT be circular.</li>
<li>No state information is transferred from the parent Policy to the child Policy.</li>
</ul>

    <blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: Consider the parent Policy http://example.com/policy:3333 that has been expressed primarly for inheritance purposes:</p>

        <li>The (child) Policy MUST access the (parent) Policy and replicate the following in the (child) Policy:
       <ul>
           <li>All policy-level Assets, Parties, Actions.</li>
           <li>All Permission and Prohibition Rules.</li>

<section id="asset">
<h3>Asset</h3>
<p>The Asset entity is a resource that is the subject of an ODRL Rule. The Asset entity can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, or services. Furthermore, it can be used to represent other <code>Asset</code> entities that are needed to undertake the Policy expression, such as with the Duty entity. The Asset entity is referred to by the Permission and/or Prohibition entities, and also by the Duty entity.</p>
<p>The Asset entity has the following attributes:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>The Asset entity MUST refer to <code>uid</code> identification of the Asset</li>
<li>The Asset entity MAY refer to the <code>scope</code> defining how the Asset shall be interpreted under different contexts.</li>
</ul>
    

<p>The identification of the Asset entity is a key foundation of the ODRL Policy language. In general, the <code>uid</code> SHOULD be a URI [[rfc3986]] representing the identifier of the Asset. There MAY also be other alternative identifiers, or identification mechanisms that could be used. For example, to identify specific parts of an Asset, Media Fragments URI [[media-frags]] may be utilised. To identify groups or a range of Assets, then POWDER [[powder-primer]], URI Templates [[rfc6570]], or URI wildcards may be utilised. To identify inline/indirect Assets, then URI fragments may be used. <p>
    
    <p>Since ODRL Policies could deal with any kind of asset, the ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata to describe Asset entities of particular media types. It is recommended to use already existing metadata standards, such as <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/" rel="external nofollow">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> that are appropriate to the Asset type or purpose.</p>


<section id="relation">
<h4>Relation</h4>

<p>The Relation entity is an association class and is used to link to an Asset from either Rule, indicating how the Asset SHOULD be utilised in respect to the entity that links to it.</p>
<p>The Relation entity has the the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Relation entity MUST refer to the <code>relation</code> indicating the relationship of the Asset to the Rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value for the <code>relation</code> attribute is <code>target</code> which indicates that the Asset is the primary object to which the Rule actions apply.</p>
    
<p>Other values for the Relation entity SHOULD be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>

<li>The Permission entity MAY refer to one or more assigner and/or assignee <code>role</code> functions undertaken by Party entities. Other <code>role</code> function values for Party MAY be used.</li>
<li>The Permission entity MAY refer to one or more <code>constraint</code>s. The Permission becomes effective if all of the constraints are satisfied.</li>
<li>The Permission entity MAY refer to one or more <code>duty</code>/ies. The Duty expresses an agreed obligation that MUST be fulfilled in order for the Permission to be valid.</li>

<h3>Prohibition</h3>

<p>The Prohibition entity indicates the Actions that are prohibited to be performed on the Asset.
<p>The Prohibition entity has the following attributes:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>The Prohibition entity MUST refer to a <code>target</code> Asset on which the identified Action MUST NOT be performed. Other <code>relation</code> values for Asset MAY be used.</li>
<li>The Prohibition entity MUST refer to an instance of an Action that indicates the operation NOT allowed on the target Asset.</li>
<li>The Prohibition entity MAY refer to one or more assigner and/or assignee <code>role</code> functions undertaken by Party entities. Other <code>role</code> function values for Party MAY be used.</li>
<li>The Prohibition entity MAY refer to one or more <code>constraint</code>s.  The Prohibition becomes effective if all of the constraints are satisfied.</li>
</ul>

<section id="duty">
<h3>Duty</h3>

<p>A Permission MAY refer to one or more Duties which indicate obligations that MUST be fulfilled in order for the Permission to be valid. A Duty is in effect as long as its associated permission is valid (i.e., the Permission's constraints are alll satisfied). A Duty MUST only be associated with a Permission. </p>
    
<p>The Duty entity has the following attributes:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>The Duty entity MUST refer to an instance of an Action that indicates the agreed operation that MUST be performed. Note: It is assumed that the assigned Party has the appropriate permissions to perform this action.</li>
    
<li>The Duty entity MAY refer to one or more assigner and/or assignee <code>role</code> functions to be undertaken by Party entities. Note: If no explicit role is specified as Assignee or Assigner, the Parties with the respective Roles are taken from the referring Permission. Other <code>role</code> function values for Party MAY be used.</li>
    
<li>The Duty entity MAY refer to a <code>target</code> Asset on which the identified agreed Action MUST be performed. Other <code>relation</code> values for Asset MAY be used. For example, a <code>nextPolicy</code> Action MUST be linked to the identifier of a target Policy asset.</li>

<li>The Duty entity MAY refer to one or more <code>constraint</code>s.  A Duty is considered to be fulfilled if its constraints are satisfied.</li>

<li>The Duty entity MAY refer to a identifier for this Duty instance. Note: this is used to refer the same Duty to multiple Permission entities.</li>
    
</ul>
    
    
    <p>If a Permission refers to several Duty entities, <em>all of them</em> MUST be agreed to be satisfied for the Permission to be undertaken. If several Permission entities refer to one Duty, then the Duty only has to be satisfied <em>once</em> for all the Permission entities.</p>
    
<p>Even though a Duty entity is mandatory (ie agreed to be undertaken by the parties), the ODRL model does not specify any specific temporal conditions on <em>WHEN</em> the Duty Action MUST be performed. Such business rules MAY be expressed through additional Constraints.  For example, a Policy may state that you can play a music file for a payment of $5.00. This does not indicate when the $5.00 should be paid as different business rules may apply, such as montly invoicing.</p>
 
    <blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The Party http://example.com/assigner:sony makes an Offer to play the music file http://example.com/music/1999.mp3. There are two Duties that both must be satisfied for the <code>compensate</code> requirement. The first is the <code>payAmount</code> of $AUD5.00 and the second is the <code>event</code> of this http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/policyUsage must not have occured yet.

<p>The Action entity indicates an operation that is applicable to an Asset. The Action is <em>permitted</em> to be performed on the target Asset when related to a Permission entity. When related to a Prohibition, the Action entity indicates the operation that is <em>prohibited</em> to be perform on the target Asset. When related to a Duty, the Action entity indicates the operation that is obligatory to be performed.</p>
    
<p>The Action entity has the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Action entity MUST refer to an instance of an Action <code>name</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] defines a standard set of common Action names that MAY be used.</p>

<section id="constraint">
<h3>Constraint</h3>
    
    <p>The Constraint entity can be used to define the context in which to process Actions in Rules, such as limitations, restrictions, or interpretations that must be applied to the Actions. Constraints are a logical expression for comparing two operands by one operator. If the logical expression evalutes to <strong>true</strong> the result of the Constraint is satisfied.</p>
        <p>
       Constraints can express these contexts with logical comparisions. For example, the number of usages (<code>leftOperand</code>) must be smaller than (<code>operator</code>) the number 10 (<code>rightOperand</code>). Constraints can also be used for complex Constraint Relations expressions that use two constraint objects as the left and right operand. For example, Constraint #1 (<code>leftOperand</code>) must be satisfied or (<code>operator</code>) Constraint #2 (<code>rightOperand</code>) must be satisfied.</p>
 
    <p>Constraints MUST be checked by processings system at the time of executing the relevant action. If the constraint is satisfied (ie the logical expression is true) then the action becomes valid for the enclosing Rule. If the constraint is not satisfied, then the action is not valid for the enclosing Rule.</p>
    
    <p>The constraint <code>leftOperand</code> MUST clearly be defined to indicate which entity is the subject of the constraint, and MAY include how the value for comparison has to be retrieved or generated. For example, the <code>count</code> constraint applies to the <code>action</code> and the <code>language</code> constraint applies to the <code>asset</code>.</p>
    
    
    <p>When multiple Constraints are attached to the same Rule they are interpreted as conjunction. A Rule becomes effective if all of its Constraints are satisfied.</p>
       
<p>The Constraint entity has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Constraint entity MUST refer to the <code>leftOperand.</code></li>
<li>The Constraint entity MUST refer to the <code>operator</code> function.</li>
<li>The Constraint entity MUST refer to the <code>rightOperand</code> (Note: only if no rightOperandReference appears.)</li>
<li>The Constraint entity MUST refer to the <code>rightOperandReference</code>(Note: only if no rightOperand appears.)</li>
<li>The Constraint entity MAY refer to the <code>dataType</code> of the rightOperand.</li>
<li>The Constraint entity MAY refer to the <code>unit</code>s of the rightOperand.</li>
<li>The Constraint entity MAY refer to the <code>status</code> of the current value generated from the leftOperand action.</li>
</ul>
        
<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>leftOperand</code> identifies the left operand of the logic expression for the Constraint. The <code>leftOperand</code> MAY be one of the Constraint Left Operands defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or from an ODRL Profile. In case of a Constraint Relations expression, the <code>leftOperand</code> MUST refer to a complete Constraint object (see <a href="#constraint-relations">Constraint Relations</a> for further requirements).
        </p>
    
<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>operator</code> identifies the logical operation such as &#8220;greater than&#8221; or &#8220;equal to&#8221 between the left and right operand. In case of a Constraint Relations expression the operator identifiers the logic relationship of two constraints using operators like 'and' or 'exclusive or'.</p>

<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>rightOperand</code> identifies the right operand of the logic expression for the Constraint. The <code>rightOperand</code> MAY be the value of the constraint that is to be compared to the <code>leftOperand</code>. The <code>rightOperand</code> represents the literal value (such as "10" or "http://example.com/c100") and <code>rightOperandReference</code> represents a URI that MUST be dereferenced to obtain the actual value. Only one between <code>rightOperand</code> and <code>rightOperandReference</code> MUST appear in the Constraint. In case of a Constraint Relations expression, the <code>rightOperand</code> MUST refer to an complete Constraint object (see <a href="#constraint-relations">Constraint Relations</a> for further requirements).</p>
        
<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>dataType</code> indicates the type of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as &#8220;xsd:decimal&#8221; or &#8220;xsd:datetime&#8221; and the <code>unit</code> indicates the unit value of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as &#8220;EU dollars&#8221;. In case of a Constraint Relations expression, the <code>dataType</code> attribute MUST NOT be used.</p>

        
<p>In case of a Constraint expression, the <code>status</code> provides the current value generated from the <code>leftOperand</code> action. For example, a <code>count</code> constraint could have a <code>rightOperand</code> value of 10, and the <code>status</code> of 5. This means that the action has alread been exercised 5 times. In case of a Constraint Relations expression, the <code>status</code> attribute MUST NOT be used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The Party http://example.com/myPix:6161 wants to assign the Permission distribute directly to the potential buyer of the Permission who will pay 100 EUR to be granted with the Permission. The distribute Permission is constrained to a specific country. The potential Assignee may then distribute the target Asset http://example.com/wallpaper:1234 according to the nextPolicy target Asset linked directly from this Permission. The next Policy Asset http://example.com/policy:7171 stipulates that the potential Assignee may only offer the display Permission to downstream consumers.</p>

<section id="constraint-relations">
    <h3>Constraint Relations</h3>
 
    <p>Constraint objects MAY also be used as both of the values for the <code>leftOperand</code> and <code>rightOperand</code> of a Constraint expression. This supports more complex Constraint Relations and allows for two constraints to be compared and processed accordingly. The two constraints MUST be <em>atomic</em> Constraints, that is, not a constraint that includes other Constraint Relations.</p>
    
    <p>The applicable <code>operators</code> that can be used for Constraint Relations are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>or</code> -  at least one of the Constraints (in the left or right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>xor</code> - only one of the Constraints (in the left or right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>and</code> - both of the Constraints (in the left and right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>andSequence</code> - the left operand constraint must deliver a satisfied result before the right operand constraint is evaluated.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <code>andSequence</code> operator is an example where there are temporal conditional requirements between atomic Constraint expressions. This may lead to situations where the outcome is unresolvable, such as "deadlock" if a Constraint expression is unable to be satisfied. Processing systems SHOULD plan for these scenarios and implement mechanisms to resolve them.</p>
    
    
<p>The processing model for Constraint Relations includes:</p>
    <ol>
       <li>If the Constraint <code>leftOperand</code> refers to a Constraint object, then the <code>rightOperand</code> MUST also refer to a Constraint object.</li>
       <li>The Constraint objects both MUST be <em>atomic</em> Constraint expressions.</li>
        <li>The Constraint objects MUST not be the same <em>atomic</em> Constraint expression.</li>
        <li>The Constraint <code>operator</code> MUST only be of the values; <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>andSequence</code>. Other values MAY be defined in ODRL Profiles exclusively for the use of Constraint Relations.</li>
        <li>The Constraint MUST not use the <code>rightOperandReference</code>, <code>dataType</code>, <code>unit</code>, or <code>status</code> attributes.</li>
       <li>If the Constraint <code>operator</code> is <code>or</code> then at least one of the Constraints (in the left or right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Constraint to be satisfied.</li> 
        <li>If the Constraint <code>operator</code> is <code>xor</code> then at only one of the Constraints (in the left or right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Constraint to be satisfied.</li>  
        <li>If the Constraint <code>operator</code> is <code>and</code> then both of the Constraints (in the left and right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Constraint to be satisfied.</li>
        <li>If the Constraint <code>operator</code> is <code>andSequence</code> then the left operand Constraint MUST return a satisfied result then the right operand Constraint MUST be evaluated and be satisfied.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Example Use Case: The Policy below shows a Permission to distribute photos in which the first constraint (the event "football/game/2017") has concluded (the operator odrl:gt indicating this), then the second constraint (wait for 60 minutes) has passed. The operator <code>andSequence</code> requires that first the constraint in the leftOperand is satisfied - the event has closed - and this triggers the Action Delay Period after which the action of the permission may be excercised. (Note: The <code>operator</code> value of <code>andSequence</code> is not the same as  <code>and</code> as for the latter, both operand Constraints must be satisfied, but could be processed at the same time.)  </p>

<h2>ODRL Profiles</h2>

    <section id="profile-motivation">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
        
<p>The ODRL Information Model serves as a framework to express Policies and the ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] provides a broad range of common actions for Permissions, Prohibition, Duties as well as Policy Types, Constraint names, Asset relations, and Party roles. For communities that implement ODRL, the entire ODRL Information Framework and the entire Vocabulary would be too onerous when they will typically have very specific needs, as well as needs not covered by the ODRL vocabulary. </p>
<p>In these common cases, it is strongly recommended that a community create and formally document an ODRL Profile. An ODRL Profile will directly serve the communities needs by excluding features of the ODRL Information Model that they do not require (for example, inheritance) and specifying only the terms of the ODRL Vocabulary they wish to support. In addition, the ODRL Profile may include additional vocabulary terms specific to their community.</p>
        <p>The ODRL Profile may also include specific implementation details on how to determine the status and processing of Rules and Constraints. For example, the ODRL Profile may require the use of a thrid-party time-service to ensure temporal constraints are meet correctly (and will document the API details etc), or document the API to access values that need to be compared to the ODRL expression values (such as what location is the asset currently being used in).</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="profile-requirements">
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
      
<p>
    The <code>profile</code> attribute in the <code>Policy</code> entity is used to indicate the identifier (URI) of the ODRL Profile for which the Policy expression conforms to. This attribute is OPTIONAL, but if the attribute appears, then any consuming system MUST understand the identified ODRL Profile and all the constraints in the ODRL Profile MUST apply to the Policy expression. If a consuming system does not understand the ODRL Profile URI, then it MAY continue processing the Policy expression, but it SHOULD NOT assume it has interpreted the Policy expression correctly. </p>
    
    <p>If multiple ODRL Profiles are required, then it is recommended that a new identifier SHOULD be created to identify the combination of Profiles (and document the combined Profiles).</p>
<p>
The requirements for communities developing ODRL Profiles MUST document the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Any additions to the Information Model</li>
<li>Any cardinality changes to the Information Model</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that will have different default values or (editorial) interpretations</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that is not being supported</li>
<li>New Vocabulary terms</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms not explicitly being suported</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms with more specific interpretations</li>
<li>The ODRL Profile identifier (URI)</li>
    </ul>
  
<p>The community SHOULD also create a machine-readable schema for their ODRL Profile following the appropriate serialisations options outlined in the ODRL Vocabulary and Expression specification [[!vocab-odrl]]. In this case, the ODRL Profile URI MUST also be used as the serialisation namespace URI.</p>

<p>It is also recommended to share the ODRL Profile with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a> for feedback and comments. In addition, the W3C ODRL Community Group may host the ODRL Profile documents on their website. </p>

    <h3>Profile Examples</h3>
<p>
An example ODRL Profile - called RightsML [[rights-ml]] was developed by the <a href="https://www.iptc.org">International Press and Telecommuncations Council</a> for the communication of usage policies, primarily in association with the licensed distribution and use of news content by news gathering agencies, publishers, licensing organisations, business intermediaries and business consumers in the online news market-place. The RightsML ODRL Profile clearly documented:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>which features of the ODRL Information Model were supported,</li>
    <li>the supported policy types,</li>
    <li>the exact list of Actions to be supported for Permissions,</li>  
    <li>more refined definitions of some ODRL vocabulary terms, and</li>
    <li>additional Actions and Constraints (specific to the News industry).</li>
</ul>
    
    <p>The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) developed a comprehensive ODRL Profile for the mobile community. Although it was based on the ODRL Version 1.1 specification [[odrl]], the documentation included detailed specifications on the ODRL vocabulary to be supported, new and refined terms, a protocol to exchange ODRL Expressions (over mobile phones), and the relevant encoding schemas. The documentation is available here [[oma-profile]].</p>
