    <p>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for describing statements about content usage. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL statements. </p>
        <p>Policies are used to explicitly state what are the permitted and prohibited actions over a certain resource. In addition, policies may be integrated with complex constraints (e.g., time constraints) which apply to such actions to impose further restrictions to the uses of the resource. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>   

<p>Several business scenarios require to express what are the permitted and prohibited actions over  content. These permitted/prohibited actions are usually expressed under the form of policies, i.e., entities that allow to indicate those uses and re-uses of the content which are conformant with the existing regulations or to the constraints assigned by the owner. Policies may also be enriched with additional information, i.e., who are the entities in charge of the definition of such Policy and those who are required to conform to it, what are the additional constrains to be associated with the Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties expressed by the Policy. The ability to express these concepts and relationships is important both for the producers of content, i.e., they may state in a clear way what are the permitted and the prohibited actions to prevent misuses, and for the consumers, i.e., they may know precisely how they are allowed to use and re-use the content to avoid breaking the law or the owner's constraints. This specification describes a common approach to expressing these concepts, and more.</p>
<p>The ODRL Information Model defines the underlying semantic model for permission and obligation statements describing content usage. The information model covers the core concepts, entities and relationships that provide the foundational model for content usage statements. These machine-readable policies may be linked directly with the content they are associated to with the aim to allow consumers to easily retrieve those information.</p>
     
<section id="aimsModel">
<h3>Aims of the Model</h3>

<p>The primary aim of the ODRL Information Model is to provide a standard description model and format to express permission and obligation statements to be associated to content in general. These permission and obligation statements are employed to describe the terms of use and reuse of  resources. The model should cover as many Permission and Obligation use cases as possible, while keeping the policy modeling easy even when dealing with complex uses.</p>

<p>The ODRL Information Model is a single, consistent model that can be used by all interested parties. All efforts have been made to keep the implementation costs for both content producers and consumers to a minimum. A single method of fulfilling a use case is strongly preferred over multiple methods, unless there are existing standards that need to be accommodated or there is a significant cost associated with using only a single method. While the Information Model is built using Linked Data principles, the design is intended to allow non-graph-based implementations also. </p>

<h2>Relationship to the W3C ODRL Community Group Reports</h2>

    
<p>The basis for the deliverables for the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group are the reports created by the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a></code>. The ODRL Community Group has developed a family of specifications to support innovative expression of  asset usage for the publication, distribution and consumption of content services.
The final outputs of the ODRL Community Group were the ODRL Version 2.1 specifications that were a major update for ODRL and superseded the original ODRL Version 1.1 [[odrl]] (published as a W3C NOTE).</p>
    
<p>The following documents are part of the ODRL Community Group report series:</p>
<ul>
<li>ODRL V2 Requirements [[odrl2-req]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Core Model [[odrl21-model]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Common Vocabulary [[odrl21-vocab]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 XML Encoding [[odrl21-xml]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Ontology [[odrl21-onto]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 JSON Encoding [[odrl21-json]]</li>
</ul>

 <p>
The ODRL Information Model was derived from the ODRL V2.1 Core Model Community Group report. Details of the differences between the W3C Working Group deliverables and the ODRL Community Group Reports are maintained in the <a href="#community">Appendix</a>. All new ODRL implementations are expected to use the deliverables of the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group. </p>

<h2>ODRL Information Model</h2>

<p>The ODRL Information Model represents Policies that express Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties related to the usage of Assets. The Information Model explicitly expresses what is allowed and what is not allowed by the Policy, as well as other terms, requirements, and parties involved. The aim of the ODRL Information Model is to enable flexible Policy expressions by allowing the policy author to include as much, or as little, detail in the Policies.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the ODRL Information Model.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="fig/00Model.svg" alt="ODRL Information Model" width="800"/>
    <figcaption>ODRL Information Model (Also available in <a href="fig/00Model.png">PNG format</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

  
    
<p>The ODRL Information Model includes the following classes:
    <ul>
        <li><code>Policy</code> - expresses Rules that are allowed (via the permission property) and/or disallowed (via the prohibition property) over an Asset. The Policy class is the  parent class to the Set, Offer, and Agreement classes.</li>
        <ul>
        <li><code>Set</code> - a subclass of Policy that supports expressing Rules.</li>
        <li><code>Offer</code> - a subclass of Policy that supports offerings of Rules from assigner Parties.</li>
        <li><code>Agreement</code> - a subclass of Policy that supports granting of Rules  from assigner to assignee Parties. </li>
        </ul>
    <li><code>Asset</code> - an identifiable resource that is related to a Rule. Examples of relation include target.</li>
    <li><code>Party</code> - an identifiable entity who may undertake a role (via the function property)in a Rule. Examples of functions include assigner and assignee. </li>
    <li><code>Action</code> - expresses an operation that can be applied to an Asset.</li>
    <li><code>Rule</code> - express the Action (via the action property), the Asset (via the relation property), the Constraint (via the constraint property), and the Party (via the function property) of the Rule. The Rule class is an abstract parent class to the Permission, Prohibition, and Duty classes and represents their common features.</li>
        <ul>
    <li><code>Permission</code> - expresses the Action that MAY be performed. The Permission MAY also include the Duty (via the duty property) that expresses an agreed Action that MUST be performed (as a requirement to be granted the Permission).</li>
    <li><code>Prohibition</code> - expresses the Action that MUST NOT be performed.</li>
    <li><code>Duty</code> - expresses the Action that has been agreed to be performed as a requirement for the applicable Permission to become valid.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><code>Constraint</code> - the context, such as limitations, restrictions, or interpretations, that must be applied to an Action.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="note">
<p>The ODRL Information Model provides a <em>logical view</em> of the components of the Policy model. The <em>implementable view</em> of the ODRL Information Model is provided by various encoding serialisations as normatively described in the ODRL Vocabulary &amp; Expression document [[odrl-vocab]]. The mapping of the logical Information Model components to the implementable serialisations may require some trade-offs and/or differences depending on the features supported by the serialisation language.</p>
</div>
    
<p>The following sections provide further details on the ODRL Information Model. </p>

<section id="policy">
<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>The Policy class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Policy MUST include the <code>uid</code> identification of the Policy.</li>
<li>A Policy MUST include the <code>permission</code> and/or <code>prohibition</code> Rule.</li>  
<li>A Policy MAY include the <code>conflict</code> property indicating how to handle Policy conflicts.(See <a href="#conflict">Policy Conflict Strategy</a> for more details.)</li>
<li>A Policy MAY include the <code>undefined</code> property indicating how to handle undefined Actions. (See <a href="#undefined">Undefined Actions</a> for more details.)</li>
<li>A Policy MAY include the <code>inheritAllowed</code> property indicating a Policy can be inherited by other Policies. (See <a href="#inhertiance">Policy Inheritance</a> for more details.)</li>
<li>A Policy MAY include the <code>profile</code> identifier of the ODRL Profile that this Policy conforms to. (See <a href="#profile">ODRL Profiles</a> for more details.)</li>
</ul>

<p>An ODRL Policy MAY be subclasssed to more precisely describe the <em>context</em> of use of the Policy that MAY include additional constraints that ODRL processors MUST understand. The Policy subclasses are documented in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or in ODRL Profiles. 
    
<section id="policy-set">
<h3>Set</h3> 

    <p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Set</code> represents any combination of Rules. The <code>Set</code> Policy subclass is also the default subclass of Policy (if none is specified) and does not assert any additional cardinalities or semantics.</p>

    <p>The <code>Set</code> Policy subclass has the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Set MUST include at least one Rule.</li>
    </ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below <code>Set</code> Policy includes the Permission to <code>play</code> the target Asset <code>http//example.com/asset:9898.movie</code>.</p>

</section>

<section id="policy-offer">
<h3>Offer</h3> 

<p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Offer</code> represents Rules that are being offered from assigner Parties. An <code>Offer</code> is typically used to make available Policies to a wider audience, but does not grant any Rules.</p>
    
    <p>The <code>Offer</code> Policy subclass has the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An Offer MUST include at least one Rule.</li>
        <li>An Offer MUST include at least one Party with <code>assigner</code> functional role.</li>

<section id="policy-agreement">
<h3>Agreement</h3> 

<p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Agreement</code> represents Rules that have been granted from assigner to assignee Parties. An <code>Agreement</code> is typically used to grant the terms of the Rules between the Parties.</p>
    
    <p>The <code>Agreement</code> Policy subclass has the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An Agreement MUST include at least one Rule.</li>
        <li>An Agreement MUST include at least one Party with <code>assigner</code> functional role.</li>

<section id="asset">
<h3>Asset</h3>
<p>An Asset is a resource that is the subject of an ODRL Rule. The Asset can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, or services. Furthermore, it can be used to represent other <code>Asset</code> classes that are needed to undertake the Policy expression, such as with a Duty. An Asset is referred to by the Permission and/or Prohibition, and also by the Duty.</p>
<p>The Asset class has the following properties:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>An Asset MUST have a <code>uid</code> identification of the Asset using an IRI [[!rfc3987]].</li>
<li>An Asset MAY have a <code>scope</code> defining how the Asset shall be interpreted under different contexts.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>By default the Asset <code>uid</code> is expressed as an IRI (which are internationalised URIs). ODRL expressions MAY also use URI Templates [[rfc6570]] to denote several Assets or Media Fragments URI [[media-frags]] to identify a specific part of an Asset.<p>
    
<p>Since ODRL Policies could deal with any kind of Asset, the ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata to describe Assets of particular media types. It is recommended to use  existing metadata standards, such as <code><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a></code> that are appropriate to the Asset type or purpose.</p>

<section id="relation">
<h4>Relation</h4>

<p>The <code>relation</code> property is used to link a Rule to an Asset, indicating how the Asset MUST be utilised in respect to the Rule that links to it. The <code>relation</code> property is represented by explicit values that indicate the semantics of the relationship between the Asset and the Rule.</p>
    
<p>The <code>relation</code> property of <code>target</code> MUST be supported. The <code>target </code> relation indicates that the Asset is the primary subject to which the Rule action directly applies.</p>
    
<p>Other <code>relation</code> properties SHOULD be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>
    
        
 <blockquote>   
<p>Example Use Case: The assigner Party <code>http//example.com/party:0001</code> offers to display the <code>target</code> Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:3333</code>.</p>
    </blockquote>
 <pre class="example hljs json">

    }]
}
</pre>

<div class="note">
    <p>In the above example, the JSON-LD representation for the <code>relation</code> property directly uses <code>target</code> as the token, as this has been mapped as a sub-property of the parent <code>relation</code> property in this serialisation.</p>

<blockquote>	
    <p>Example Use Case: The below Policy shows the <code>index</code> action Permission on the target Asset <code>http://example.com/archive1011</code>. Another Asset relation <code>x:collection</code> is also expressed to indicate the Asset <code>http://example.com/x/database</code> that the indexing outcome should be stored in.

</pre>
    
</section>
	
<section id="asset-scope">
<h4>Scope</h4>
    
    <p>The <code>scope</code> property SHOULD be used to indicate the context under which to identify the Asset. The purpose of <code>scope</code> is to provide additional contextual information about the Asset that more precisely identifies the target for the Policy.
        The <code>scope</code> feature is useful is there is no ability to directly identify the target Asset with a <code>uid</code> identifier.
        For example, the Asset identifier may refer to a resource that is a collection or items with many different characteristics, but the <code>scope</code> may identify one specific characteristic only. That <code>scope</code> would then identify the actual target Asset(s) for the Policy.</p>
    
<p>The <code>scope</code> property IRI values SHOULD be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>
</section>

    
    <blockquote>
    <p>Example Use Case: The Policy defines a target Asset <code>http://example.com/media-catalogue</code> that is a collection of multimedia files. The target Asset also has a scope of <code>http://example.com/imt/jpeg</code>. That scope specifies further context on what characteristics the Asset items must hold - in this case, the target Asset(s) will be all the files identified by the taget <code>uid</code> that are of type "jpeg".</p>
        <p>The <code>scope</code> is defined in the ODRL Profile <code>http://example.com/profiles/01</code>. It is considered good practice that the scope and profile URIs are not mere identifiers but dereference to human- and machine-readable documentation. See <a href="#profile">ODRL Profiles</a> for further information.

<section id="party">
<h3>Party</h3>
    
<p>A Party can be any form of identifiable entity who undertakes a role in the Policy, such as a person, group of people, organisation, or agent. An agent is a person or thing that takes an active Role or produces a specified effect. The Party performs (or does not perform) Actions or has a function in a Duty (i.e., assigns the Party to the Rule by associating it with the function it plays in the Rule).</p>
    
<p>The Party class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Party MUST have a <code>uid</code> identifier of the Party</li>
<li>A Party MUST have a <code>function</code> indicating the role undertaken by the Party.</li>
<li>A Party MAY have a <code>scope</code> defining how the Party shall be interpreted under different contexts.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>The ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata for the Party class. It is recommended to use existing metadata standards, such as the W3C vCard Ontology [[vcard-rdf]] or FOAF Vocabulary [[foaf]].</p>
 
    
<section id="function">
<h4>Function</h4>
    
 <p>The <code>function</code> property is used to link a Rule to a Party, indicating the function undertaken by the Party in respect to the Rule that links to it. The <code>function</code> property is represented by explicit values that indicate the semantics of the functional role between the Party and the Rule.</p>

<p>The <code>function</code> property MUST support the following roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>assigner</code>: indicates the Party that is issuing the Policy. For example, the Party granting a Permission or requiring an agreed Duty to be performed.</li>
<li><code>assignee</code>: indicates that the Party that is the recipient the Policy. For example, the Party being granted a Permission or required to perform an agreed Duty.</li>

<h4>Scope</h4>
    
<p>The <code>scope</code> property SHOULD be used to indicate the context under which to identify the Party. The purpose of <code>scope</code> is to provide additional contextual information about the Party that more precisely identifies the extent of the Party identified. The <code>scope</code> feature is useful is there is no ability to directly identify the intended Party with a <code>uid</code> identifier.
        For example, the Party identifier may refer to all users at a University, but the <code>scope</code> may contextualise that to only "fulltime staff members" at the University.</p>
        
     <p>The <code>scope</code> property MAY be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Individual</code>: indicates that a Party is a single individual. The linked Permission, Duty or Prohibition is applicable for that individual only.</li>
<li><code>Group</code>: indicates that a Party represents a group of individual members. The linked Permission, Duty or Prohibition is applicable to each member of that group.

<h3>Action</h3>


<p>An Action indicates an operation that can be applied to an Asset. An Action is associated to the Asset with the <code>action</code> property in a Rule.
    
    <p>An Action is <em>permitted</em> to be performed on the target Asset when related to a Permission. When related to a Prohibition, the Action indicates the operation that is <em>prohibited</em> to be performed on the target Asset. When related to a Duty, the Action indicates the agreed operation that is <em>obligatory</em> to be performed.</p>
    
<p>The ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] defines a standard set of common Actions that MAY be used and ODRL Profiles MAY also define Actions.</p>

<h3>Rule</h3>


<p>The Rule class is the parent of the Permission, Prohibition, and Duty classes. The Rule class represents the common characteristics of these three classes.
</p>

<p>The Rule class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Rule MUST have a <code>target</code> Asset. Other <code>relation</code> values for Asset MAY be used.</li>
<li>A Rule MUST have an Action via the <code>action</code> property.</li>
<li>A Rule MAY have one or more assigner and/or assignee <code>function</code> roles undertaken by Party entities. Other <code>function</code> properties for Party MAY be used.</li>
<li>A Rule  MAY have one or more Constraints via the <code>constraint</code> property. The Rule becomes effective if all of the Constraints are satisfied.</li>
    <li>A Rule MAY have a <code>uid</code> identifier to enable the Rule to be identified by other Rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a Rule to become effective, it MUST be valid (ie all it's constraints MUST be satisfied).</p>

    
    
<section id="permission">
<h3>Permission</h3>


<p>A Permission class is a  subclass of Rule that specifies the Actions that MAY be <strong>performed</strong> on an Asset. The Permission class inherits all the properties from the Rule class.</p>

<p>In addition to the Rule properties, the Permission class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Permission  MAY have one or more Duties via the <code>duty</code> property. The Duty expresses an agreed obligation that MUST be fulfilled in order for the Permission to be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a Permission to become effective, it MUST be valid (ie all it's constraints MUST be satisfied) and all of the Permission's Duties MUST be fulfilled.</p>

<h3>Prohibition</h3>

<p>A Prohibition class is a  subclass of Rule that specifies the Actions that MUST NOT be <strong>performed</strong> on an Asset. The Prohibition class inherits all the properties from the Rule class.</p>

<p>For a Prohibition to become effective, it MUST be valid (ie all it's constraints MUST be satisfied).</p>

<section id="duty">
<h3>Duty</h3>

<p>A Duty class is a subclass of Rule that specifies agreed Actions that are <strong>obligatory</strong> and MUST be fulfilled. A Duty is only associated with a Permission. The Permission is valid (including the Permission's constraints all being satisfied) if and only if the Duty has been fulfilled. The Duty class inherits all the properties from the Rule class.</p>

<p>In addition to the Rule properties, the Duty class has these additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
   <li>A Duty MUST only be associated with a Permission.</li> 
    <li>A Duty MAY have a <code>target</code> Asset on which the agreed Action MUST be performed. 
  <li>It is assumed that any assigned Party has the appropriate permissions to perform the Duty Action.</li>
<li>If no explicit Party <code>function</code> is specified as assignee or assigner of the Duty, the Parties with the respective functional roles are taken from the referring Permission. Other <code>function</code> roles for Party MAY be used for Duties (for example, Compensated Party or Tracking Party).</li>

</ul>
    
    
<p>If a Permission has several Duty entities then all of the Duties MUST be agreed to be satisfied for the Permission to be valid. If several Permissions refer to a single Duty, then the Duty only has to be satisfied <em>once</em> for all the Permissions to be valid.</p>
    
<p>Even though a Duty is mandatory (ie agreed to be undertaken by the Parties), the ODRL Information Model does not specify any specific temporal conditions on <em>WHEN</em> the Duty Action MUST be performed. Such business rules MAY be expressed through additional Constraints.  For example, a Policy may state that you can play a music file for a payment of $5.00. This does not indicate when the $5.00 should be paid as different business rules may apply, such as monthly invoicing or streaming.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The Party <code>http://example.com/assigner:sony</code> makes an Offer to play the music file <code>http://example.com/music/1999.mp3</code>. There are two Duties that both must be satisfied for the <code>compensate</code> requirement. The first is the <code>payAmount</code> of $AUD5.00 and the second is the <code>event</code> of <code>policyUsage</code> must not have occurred yet (that is, the payment is made before the policy is exercised).

<section id="constraint">
<h3>Constraint</h3>
    
    <p>A Constraint can be used to define the context in which to process Actions in Rules, such as limitations, restrictions, or interpretations that are applied to the Actions. Constraints can be represented as <em>Atomic Constraints</em> - in which the left and right operands are logically compared - or as <em>Compound Constraints</em> in which the left and right operands are existing <em>Atomic Constraints</em>.</p>
    
    <p>ODRL Processors MUST check all constraints at the time of executing the relevant Action. If the constraint is satisfied then the action becomes valid for the enclosing Rule. If the constraint is not satisfied, then the action is not valid for the enclosing Rule.</p>
 
    <p>When multiple Constraints apply to the same Rule they are interpreted as conjunction. A Rule becomes effective if all of its Constraints are satisfied.</p>
    
<section id="constraint-atomic">
<h3>Atomic Constraint</h3>
        
<p>Atomic Constraints are logical expressions for comparing two operands by one operator. If the logical expression evaluates to <strong>true</strong> the result of the Constraint is satisfied.
Atomic Constraints can express these contexts with logical comparisons. For example, the number of usages (<code>leftOperand</code>) must be smaller than (<code>operator</code>) the number 10 (<code>rightOperand</code>). 
</p>
       
<p>The Atomic Constraint class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MUST have a <code>leftOperand</code> - the left operand</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MUST have an <code>operator</code>- the logical operation</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MUST have a <code>rightOperand</code> - the right operand (only REQUIRED if no rightOperandReference appears)</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MUST have a <code>rightOperandReference</code> - a reference to a right operand (only REQUIRED if no rightOperand appears)</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MAY  have a <code>dataType</code> - the type of the rightOperand/Reference</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MAY have a <code>unit</code> - the unit value of the rightOperand/Reference</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MAY have a <code>status</code> - the current value generated from the leftOperand action</li>
</ul>
        
    
<p>The <code>leftOperand</code> MAY be one of the Constraint Left Operands defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or from an ODRL Profile. The <code>leftOperand</code> MUST clearly be <strong>defined</strong> to indicate the subject of the constraint, and MAY include how the value for comparison has to be retrieved or generated. For example, the <code>count</code> constraint applies to the <code>action</code> and the <code>language</code> constraint applies to the <code>asset</code>.</p>
    
<p>The <code>operator</code> identifies the logical operation such as &#8220;greater than&#8221; or &#8220;equal to&#8221 between the left and right operands.</p>

<p>The <code>rightOperand</code> identifies the right operand of the logic expression. The <code>rightOperand</code> MAY be the value of the Constraint that is to be compared to the <code>leftOperand</code>. The <code>rightOperand</code> represents the literal value (such as <code>10</code> or <code>http://example.com/c100</code>) and <code>rightOperandReference</code> represents an IRI that MUST be dereferenced first to obtain the actual value of the <code>rightOperand</code>. A <code>rightOperandReference</code> is used in cases where the value of the <code>rightOperand</code> MUST be obtained from dereferencing an IRI. Only one of <code>rightOperand</code> and <code>rightOperandReference</code> MUST appear in the Atomic Constraint.</p>
        
<p>The <code>dataType</code> indicates the type of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as <code>xsd:decimal</code> or <code>xsd:datetime</code> and the <code>unit</code> indicates the unit value of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as &#8220;EU currency&#8221;.</p>

<p>The <code>status</code> provides the current value generated from the <code>leftOperand</code> action. For example, a <code>count</code> constraint could have a <code>rightOperand</code> value of 10, and the <code>status</code> of 5. This means that the action has already been exercised 5 times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: In the first example below, the Party <code>http://example.com/myPix:6161</code> wants to offer the  <code>distribute</code> Permission for a specific country for the target Asset. The offer has two Duties to <code>compensate</code> the assigner and a <code>nextPolicy</code>. The potential assignee may distribute the target Asset <code>http://example.com/wallpaper:1234</code> according to the Policy target Asset. The second exmaple shows that the Policy  <code>http://example.com/policy:7171</code> stipulates  the potential assignee may only offer the <code>display</code> Permission to other parties.</p>

<h3>Compound Constraint</h3>
 
 <p>   
    Compound Constraints refer to two exisiting Atomic Constraints as the left and right operand. For example, Atomic Constraint #1 (<code>leftOperand</code>) must be satisfied <strong>or</strong> (<code>operator</code>) Atomic Constraint #2 (<code>rightOperand</code>) must be satisfied. The Compound Constraint operator identifiers the logical relationship between the two Atomic Constraints using operators such as <strong>and</strong> or <strong>exclusive or</strong>.</p>

      
<p>The Compound Constraint class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Compound Constraint MUST have a <code>leftOperand</code> - the left operand</li>
<li>A Compound Constraint MUST have a <code>operator</code>- the logical relationship</li>
<li>A Compound Constraint MUST have a <code>rightOperand</code> - the right operand</li>
</ul>
        
    
<p>The applicable <code>operator</code> that can be used for Compound Constraint are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>or</code> -  at least one of the Atomic Constraints (in the left or right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>xor</code> - only one of the Atomic Constraints (in the left or right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>and</code> - both of the Atomic Constraints (in the left and right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>andSequence</code> - the left operand Atomic Constraint must deliver a satisfied result before the right operand Atomic Constraint is evaluated.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other <code>operator</code> values MAY be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or ODRL Profiles.</p>
    
<p>The <code>andSequence</code> operator is an example where there are temporal conditional requirements between the two left and rigt operands. This may lead to situations where the outcome is unresolvable, such as <em>deadlock</em> if one of the Atomic Constraints is unable to be satisfied. ODRL Processing systems SHOULD plan for these scenarios and implement mechanisms to resolve them.</p>
    
<p>The processing model for Compound Constraints includes:</p>
    <ol>
       <li>The left and right operands MUST both be Atomic Constraints.</li>
         <li>The left and right operands MUST NOT be the same Atomic Constraint.</li>
        <li>The <code>operator</code> MUST only be of the values; <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>andSequence</code>. Other values MAY be defined in ODRL Profiles exclusively for the use of Compound Constraints.</li>
       <li>If the <code>operator</code> is <code>or</code> then at least one of the Atomic Constraints (in the left or right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Compound Constraint to be satisfied.</li> 
        <li>If the <code>operator</code> is <code>xor</code> then at only one of the Atmomic Constraints (in the left or right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Compound Constraint to be satisfied.</li>  
        <li>If the <code>operator</code> is <code>and</code> then both of the Atmoic Constraints (in the left and right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Compound Constraint to be satisfied.</li>
        <li>If the <code>operator</code> is <code>andSequence</code> then the left operand Atomic Constraint MUST return a satisfied result then the right operand Atomic Constraint MUST be evaluated and be satisfied.</li>
    </ol>

<h4>Policy Composition</h4>
             
    <p>A Policy MAY contain multiple Rules, and each Rule MAY contain multiple Assets, Parties, Actions, Constraints, and Duties. A Policy MAY also contain Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level, and these entities apply to all of the enclosing Rules in the Policy.</p>
     
    <p>At the core level, an ODRL Rule would include one Asset, one or more Parties, one Action, and potentially one Constraint and/or Duty, as shown in the example below. This example shows the <em>atomic</em> level of a Policy where it is a irreducible Rule (that is, not able to be reduced or further simplified).</p>
             
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:7777",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
    }]
} 
</pre>

<p>As multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions can be expressed for each Rule, the following example shows two Assets defined for the policy:</p>
    
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "target": [ "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
                    "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3"],
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
    }]
}
</pre>

<p>The above example could then be reduced to two <em>atomic</em> Rules, with the two target assets appearing individually in each:</p>
    
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
    },
    {
        "target": "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
    }]
}
</pre>
    
    <p>In order to create the <em>atomic</em> Rules in a Policy, the processing model for policies with multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Where there are multiple Assets (with the same relation), then create new Rules (one for each of these Assets) and include only one Asset relation, and include all other (non-Asset) properties, in each Rule</li>
    <li>Where there are multiple Parties (with the same function), then create new Rules (one for each of these Parties) and include only one Party function, and include all other (non-Party) properties, in each Rule.</li>
    <li>Where there are multiple Actions, then create new Rules (one for each of these Actions) and include only one Action, and include all other (non-Action) properties, in each Rule.</li>
    </ol>
       
    <p>An ODRL Policy MAY also declare multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level (not just within a Rule). This implies that these classes are all common to all the Rules in the Policy, as shown in the below example:</p>
             
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
    "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
    "action": "play",
    "permission": [{
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy"
        }]
}  
</pre>

<p>To fully expand the Rules, the Policy-level Assets, Parties, and Actions MUST be added to all the Rules in the Policy. As shown below, the policy-level target, assigner, and action are added to the two permission Rules:</p>
    
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "play"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy",
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "play",
        }]
}  
</pre>  
  
    <p>The processing model for Policies with multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions declared at the Policy-level includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Assets in each and all Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
   <li>Replicate all Policy-level Parties in each and all Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Actions in each and all Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
      <li>Follow the processing model (defined above) to create <em>atomic</em> Rules in the Policy.</li>  
    </ol>
       
    
    
    </section>
             
     <section id="provenace">
<h4>Policy Provenance</h4>
         
       <p>Provenance properties MAY be added to a Policy to support additional authenticity, and integrity purposes from external vocabularies. The ODRL Information Model recommends the use of Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[!dcterms]] for ODRL Policies.</p>
         
         <p>The following Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[!dcterms]] SHOULD be used:</p>
            <ul>
         <li><code>dc:creator</code> - the individual, agent, or organisation that authored the Policy.</li>      <li><code>dc:description</code> - a human-readable representation or summary of the Policy.</li>
         <li><code>dc:issued</code> - the date (and time) the Policy was first issued.</li>
         <li><code>dc:modified</code> -  the date (and time) the Policy was updated.</li>
        <li><code>dc:coverage</code> -  the jurisdiction under which the Policy is relevant.</li>
        <li><code>dc:replaces</code> -  the identifier (uid) of a Policy that this Policy supersedes.</li>
        <li><code>dc:isReplacedBy</code> -  the identifier (uid) of a Policy that supersedes this Policy.</li>
         </ul>
         
    <p>The processing model for Policies with the above provenance properties include:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>If a Policy contains the <code>dc:isReplacedBy</code> property, then a processor MUST consider the first Policy invalid and MUST retrieve and process the identified Policy.</li>
    </ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below example contains provenance properties that indicate who created the Policy, when the Policy was issued, which jurisdiction (Queensland, Australia) the Policy applies to, and an older version of the Policy it replaces.</p>     </blockquote>

    <section id="conflict">
<h4>Policy Conflict Strategy</h4>
        
<p>The <code>conflict</code> property is used to establish strategies to resolve conflicts that arise from the merging of Policies or conflicts between Permissions and Prohibitions in the same Policy. Conflicts may arise when merging Policies about the same Asset and the resultant Actions are inconsistent.</p>
      
    <p>The <code>conflict</code> property MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perm</code>: the Permissions MUST override the Prohibitions</li>
<li><code>prohibit</code>: the Prohibitions MUST override the Permissions</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the entire Policy MUST be invalid if any conflict is detected</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>conflict</code> property is not explicitly set, the default of <code>invalid</code> will be used.</p>

        
<p>If an ODRL processor does not detect any conflicts in the Rules, then the ODRL Policy is valid, otherwise the ODRL processor MUST follow these processing rules:</p>
   
<ol>
        <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>perm</code> then any conflicting Permission Rule MUST override the Prohibition Rule and continue with the Policy as valid.</li>
 <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>prohibit</code> then any conflicting Prohibition Rule MUST override the Permission Rule and continue with the Policy as valid.</li>
  <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>invalid</code> then  processing MUST not continue and the entire Policy MUST be invalid.</li> 
 <li>If a Policy has multiple <code>conflict</code> property values (for example, after a Policy merge or inheritance) then processing MUST not continue and the entire Policy MUST be invalid.</li> 
        </ol>
       
        
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: Two Policies are associated to the same target Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:1212</code>. The first Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:0001</code> allows to <code>use</code> the Asset. The second Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:0002</code> allows for the display of the Asset, but it prohibits <code>print</code>. Both policies explicitly state how to deal with conflicts through the <code>conflict</code> property being set to <code>perm</code>. Hence the Permissions will always override any Prohibitions. In this use case, since the <code>print</code> Action is a specialisation of the <code>use</code> Action, there could be a conflict. However, the <code>perm</code> conflict strategy means that the <code>use</code> Permission will override the <code>print</code> Prohibition.</p>

<p>In the above use case, if the second Policy had the conflict value of <code>prohibit</code>, then the outcome would be a direct contradiction, and the result will be an invalid Policy.</p>

<h4>Undefined Actions</h4>
    
        
<div class="issue" data-number="105">
    <p>The detection of undefined actions is viewed to be implementation-specific, and too vague to be part of the Information Model. This feature maybe removed in future versions.</p>
</div>
             
<p>The <code>undefined</code> property is used to indicate how to process unsupported Actions. That is, if an ODRL expression contains an Action that is not from a known (or supported) ODRL vocabulary, how should the Action be treated in the context of the whole ODRL Policy?</p>
        
 <p>The <code>undefined</code> property MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>support</code>: the undefined Action is to be <strong>supported</strong> as part of the Policy &#8211; and the Policy remains valid</li>
<li><code>ignore</code>: the undefined Action is to be <strong>ignored</strong> and is not part of the Policy &#8211; and the Policy remains valid</li>
    <li><code>invalid</code>: the undefined Action is unknown &#8211; and the entire Policy is <strong>invalid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, ODRL processors SHOULD provide mechanisms that adequately address these three outcomes. That is, how the Action can be <strong>supported</strong>, or <strong>ignored</strong>, or the entire Policy is <strong>invalid</strong>. </p>


        <p>If the <code>undefined</code> property is not explicitly set, its default of <code>invalid</code> SHALL be used.</p>
        
                
<p>The processing model for undefined actions includes:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>If a Policy has the <code>undefined</code> property of <code>support</code> and there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the processing system MUST support these actions as part of the valid Policy.</li>
    <li>If a Policy has the <code>undefined</code> property of <code>ignore</code> and there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the processing system MUST disregard these actions as part of the valid Policy.</li>
    <li>If a Policy has the <code>undefined</code> property of <code>invalid</code> and there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the processing system MUST process the entire Policy as invalid.</li>
     <li>If a Policy has multiple <code>undefined</code> property values (for example, after a Policy merge) AND there are actions in the Policy now known to the processing system, then the entire Policy MUST be processed as invalid.</li> 
    </ol>
      
        
<blockquote>
  <p>Example Use Case: A Policy of type <code>Set</code> states that the Asset can be <em>recorded</em>. The processing system does not understand this Action, and since the <code>undefined</code> property is <code>invalid</code>, then the entire Policy is deemed invalid.</p>

<section id="inhertiance">
<h4>Policy Inheritance</h4>

    <p>ODRL supports a simple inheritance mechanism in which a (child) Policy may inherit all the atomic Rules of the (parent) Policy.</p>
    
<p>The <code>inheritAllowed</code> property in the Policy is used to indicate if the Policy expression can be used in any inheritance relationship. If present, the value of the <code>inheritAllowed</code> property MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code>: the Policy expression MAY be used for inheritance</li>
<li><code>false</code>: the Policy expression MUST NOT be used for inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>inheritAllowed</code> property is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>true</code> will be used.</p>
    
<p>The following property SHOULD be used in a child Policy that is inheriting from a parent Policy in which that parent Policy MUST allow inheritance (via the <code>inheritAllowed</code> property) :</p>

    <ul>
    <li><code>inheritFrom</code>: the identifier (<code>uid</code>) of the parent Policy from which this child Policy inherits from</li>
    </ul>


<p>The following restrictions apply when using inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single inheritance is only supported. That is, one parent Policy to one or more child Policies. No child Policy can inherit from two or more parent Policies.</li>
<li>Inheritance can be to any depth. (Multiple levels of children Policies.)</li>
<li>Inheritance MUST NOT be circular.</li>
<li>No constraint <code>status</code> information is transferred from the parent Policy to the child Policy. That is, if the parent Policy had <code>status</code> properties with values, then these values would be nulled.</li>
</ul>

    <blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: Consider the parent Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:default</code> below that has been expressed primarily for inheritance purposes (the assinger wishes to provide default permissions for all Policies). It does not include any target Asset and allows the archive and annotate Permissions and the aggregate Prohibition.</p>

<p>The child <code>Agreement</code>Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:4444</code> below includes the <code>inheritFrom property</code> pointing to the parent Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:default</code> (above).

</pre>
    
   
    
<p>The processing model for ODRL Policy Inheritance includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>A (child) Policy with an <code>inheritFrom</code> property MUST first verify that the (parent) Policy does not contain the <code>inheritAllowed</code> property with the value <strong>false</strong>.</li>
        <li>The (child) Policy MUST access the (parent) Policy and replicate the following in the (child) Policy:
       <ul>
           <li>All policy-level Assets, Parties, Actions.</li>
           <li>All Permission and Prohibition Rules.</li>
       </ul>
            </li>
      <li>The (child) Policy can then be further expanded (into <em>atomic</em> Rules) by following the processing models defined in the <a href="#composition">Policy Composition</a> section.</li>

<h2>ODRL Profiles</h2>

    <section id="profile-motivation">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
        
<p>The ODRL Information Model serves as a framework to express Policies and the ODRL vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] provides a broad range of common actions for Permissions, Prohibition, Duties as well as Policy Types, Constraint names, Asset relations, and Party roles. For communities that implement ODRL, the entire ODRL Information Framework and the entire Vocabulary would be too onerous when they will typically have very specific needs, as well as needs not covered by the ODRL vocabulary. </p>
<p>In these common cases, it is strongly recommended that a community create and formally document an ODRL Profile. An ODRL Profile will directly serve the communities needs by excluding features of the ODRL Information Model that they do not require (for example, inheritance) and specifying only the terms of the ODRL Vocabulary they wish to support. In addition, the ODRL Profile may include additional vocabulary terms specific to their community.</p>
        <p>The ODRL Profile may also include specific implementation details on how to determine the status and processing of Rules and Constraints. For example, the ODRL Profile may require the use of a third-party time service to ensure temporal constraints are meet correctly (and will document the API details etc), or document the API to access values that need to be compared to the ODRL expression values (such as what location is the asset currently being used in).</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="profile-requirements">
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
      
<p>
    The <code>profile</code> property in a <code>Policy</code>  is used to indicate the identifier (IRI) of the ODRL Profile for which the Policy expression conforms to. This property is OPTIONAL, but if the property appears, then any consuming system MUST understand the identified ODRL Profile and all the constraints in the ODRL Profile MUST apply to the Policy expression. If a consuming system does not understand the ODRL Profile, then it MAY continue processing the Policy expression, but it SHOULD NOT assume it has interpreted the Policy expression correctly. </p>
    
    <p>If multiple ODRL Profiles are required, then it is recommended that a new identifier SHOULD be created to identify the combination of Profiles (and document the combined Profiles).</p>
<p>
The requirements for communities developing ODRL Profiles MUST document the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Any additions to the Information Model</li>
<li>Any cardinality changes to the Information Model</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that will have different default values or (editorial) interpretations</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that is not being supported</li>
<li>New Vocabulary terms</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms not explicitly being supported</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms with more specific interpretations</li>
<li>The ODRL Profile identifier (IRI)</li>
    </ul>
  
<p>The community SHOULD also create a machine-readable schema for their ODRL Profile following the appropriate serialisations options outlined in the ODRL Vocabulary and Expression specification [[!vocab-odrl]]. In this case, the ODRL Profile IRI MUST also be used as the serialisation namespace.</p>

<p>It is also recommended to share the ODRL Profile with the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a></code> for feedback and comments. In addition, the W3C ODRL Community Group may host the ODRL Profile documents on their website. </p>

    <h3>Profile Examples</h3>
<p>
An example ODRL Profile - called RightsML [[rights-ml]] was developed by the <code><a href="https://www.iptc.org">International Press and Telecommunications Council</a></code> for the communication of usage policies, primarily in association with the licensed distribution and use of news content by news gathering agencies, publishers, licensing organisations, business intermediaries and business consumers in the online news market-place. The RightsML ODRL Profile clearly documented:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>which features of the ODRL Information Model were supported,</li>
    <li>the supported Policy classes,</li>
    <li>the exact list of Actions to be supported for Permissions,</li>  
    <li>more refined definitions of some ODRL vocabulary terms, and</li>
    <li>additional Actions and Constraints (specific to the News industry).</li>
</ul>
    
    <p>The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) developed a comprehensive ODRL Profile for the mobile community. Although it was based on the ODRL Version 1.1 specification [[odrl]], the documentation included detailed specifications on the ODRL vocabulary to be supported, new and refined terms, a protocol to exchange ODRL Expressions (over mobile phones), and the relevant encoding schemas. The documentation is available here [[oma-profile]].</p>

    ODRL Policies that support the <code>Privacy</code> Policy subclass may contain links to potentially sensitive personal information such as the identity of parties and the identity of the existence of assets containing such data related to the parties. Implementations that produce or consume ODRL Privacy expressions must take steps to communicate to all relevant users the manner in which the policy is being used, the identity of any other party with whom that policy is being shared, and the reason the policy is being shared with other parties.
